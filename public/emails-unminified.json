A pall settled over us this morning, seeking to drown us, and if unsuccessful in that endeavor, then trying to wear us down, slowly but surely, both emotionally and, as the master eroder it is, physically. Will we let it succeed? Will we be reduced to nothing, erased from the histories, and referred to only obliquely in the myths handed down to someone else’s children’s children’s children as a way to scare those mouthy little cretins and keep them from acting up all the time? While that may be our fate regardless, I will not dissolve into it willingly. Instead, let us band together, and shore up our collective will with the sandbags of friendship! The best way I can think of to do this is to eat a bunch of food, so let’s do that. We’re gonna make some pork tenderloin and prolly some feesh. Please feel free to bring sides, salad, snacks, dranks or whatever feels good. I look forward to seeing you all, and hopefully we can buoy each other’s spirits against the gloom above.<br><br>I want to breathe in the open wind<br>I want to kiss like lovers do<br>I want to dive into your ocean<br>Is it raining with you,<br><br>Lissendaff\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

It’s like we’re all too tightly wound up and closed off. I know I’ve said this before, but I think I have a new fad we can try out that’ll really shake up the routine, you know? And Karen, before you even say it, the destination dinner parties WERE a good idea, and you loved them at first, but yes, they did become tiresome after a while. The change in scenery did lower our barriers for a bit, but the planning became such a drain that we couldn’t enjoy the meals or each other’s company. But this is so much better, and so much easier. It’s called brieing. All we have to do is crush up MDMA and stuff it into brie, and then scarf down a whole bunch. In like 40 minutes, we’ll finally be able to open up and discuss our emotions like we all want to deep down, but can’t seem to bring ourselves to. Colors will become more vivid, massages will feel fucking awesome, and we can all describe our craziest sexual fantasies, and I’m sure there will be absolutely no emotional fallout from this. Oh, I can’t wait! I called my son, and he confirmed that you eat the MDMA, you don’t snort it, which I sort of default to since the only drugs I’ve ever done is about a horseload of coke during graduate school, right, girls? Cindy knows what I’m talkin’ about. So thank god I called him first. The last thing I want is a Pulp Fiction type situation where I’m carting one of you crazy bitches to my old pusher to inject your heart with adrenaline, while you sing the song Aquarius with a nosebleed and a thousand-yard stare. Anyways, brie is great, and from what I hear, MDMA is really going to enhance our discussion and take our friendship to the next level. So see ya tonight, gals, and get ready to open your mind and your heart, and try to avoid the sickening depression that settles in after using MDMA for a while.<br><br>So come on over this eventime! We’re gonna grill up some stuff, most likely chicken and feesh. If peeps can bring salad and/or grillable veggies, that would be fantastic. It also appears to be a lovely day, so some outside hangage seems like a distinct possibility.<br><br>May all your brie be stank, and your high be dank,<br>We will continue to be,<br>Forever and always,<br>Enablingly yours,<br>Lissendaff\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

I, quite honestly, cannot. Therefore I will need you to come to my house and narrate what happens, doing your best to convince me everything that is happening is real.

As we all know, many years ago, he took leave of the warmth and safety that comes along with a tightly knit friend group embedded within a furnace of cultural abundance and used that cachet to strike out and live a wild life on the Midwestern frontier. While he has yet to squander all of his wealth whilst leading his wanton and outrageous lifestyle deep in the clogged arteries nearest the heart of America, he, much like his predecessor of parable fame, has realized he has sinned against us and against our coastal elite god. He is returning to repent his choice of turning his back on his liberal past to be subsumed into a world where college athletes are not named Rusty Cockring or Ebenezer Coli, and a state where one’s vote might actually matter. But before he can prostrate himself before us and admit the folly of his ways, we must fetch him the finest cloaks and rings, and restore him to the luxurious, nigh-aristocratic, ivory tower lifestyle that we snowflake SJWs take for granted. We will play music and rejoice, and kill the fatted calf in his honor! Do not be like the older brother of the parable, envious of the immediate forgiveness given and welcoming back into the fold. We are not owed more, regardless of our slavish devotion to these ideals and his utter disregard for them. He was lost, but now has been found. We can all celebrate and be glad, until he once again turns tail and pursues optimal mental and and physical performance through biohacks and macramé.<br><br>So before that inevitably happens, let us gather together and eat and drink and dance and sing and ring in the new with our long lost TTT. We will make a bunch of food, the substance of which we are still in the process of determining, and hang out with all you lovely people. Feel free to bring drinkage, snackage, and any other –ages you deem fit. Adages are also welcome.

The world we walk through every day is quite simply a simulacrum, a system put in place to make sure we all march along in a nice, orderly fashion, never questioning and simply providing energy and labor for those truly in power. Of late, the northeast has not been particularly compliant, which is why those in power have punished us with a seemingly unending winter. Clearly, the shadowy figures pulling the strings also do not care for long distance runners, probably because that shit is cray. Regardless, the long night may be over. Finally, after years of searching and investigating and reading and asking the correct questions and seeing clues where others couldn’t possibly see clues and never believing for a second that the world could be run by large communities of people that find common ties in order to better their lives and the lives of those around them by forming governments to regulate various aspects of the economy and how people interact with other people within that community and other large communities and their constituents and that the delicate balance of these interactions is what drives world politics and economics, but instead perceiving the truth and understanding at the deepest levels of my consciousness that a small cabal of ultra-powerful figures from all over the world are pulling at tiny, almost imperceptible strings, causing all that occurs in the world at all times.<br><br>While this is obvious to a few of us, and a very small few at that, we are looked at as “interesting,” or “a little off, but fun in small doses,” or “hot, but in a quirky way,” or “barely holding on to the last few threads of reality, but is still really nice; like, he would pick you up at the airport or help you move, but he’d prolly talk your ear off about some weird shit and may invite you over to see his ‘Truth Wall,’ which you definitely SHOULD NOT do,” rather than “visionary,” “brilliant,” or “the iconoclast that will recreate the world into the vision the sheep are too afraid to see, and I’m just trying to let you in on the ground floor so you’ll be safe and rule by my side.” Ears regardless, I have done it. At long last, after what feels like multiple lifetimes of constant struggle, I have been handed the ultimate opportunity. The Illuminati have reached out to me, and I will obviously be seeking to join their ranks. Know that I do this not to abandon you, but instead to lift all of you up in the most effective way possible. Below is my complete invitation, which was received today. I know what you’re thinking, “Stupid Dave, I can just email them and then I’LL be the one in power, and they’ll hate Dave for carelessly spreading this information when they’ve spent quite literally all of recorded history trying not to be uncovered or even talked about.” Well, dummy, think about it. They already know and control EVERYTHING, and they’ve reached out to me, by email, knowing that I write annoyingly long emails EVERY MONDAY, so of course they knew I would include this, and that you guys will simply ignore this straightforward invitation, thinking it’s some sort of scam. Soooooo, not so worried over here.<br><br>However, because this “recruitment scheme” lasts until May, I doubt they will send a stealth zeppelin to pick me up by this eventime, so we will have our usual Monday hangs. In order to keep all you cloudy-brained plebes fat and happy, we will be making pulled pork, mac n’ chee, and slaw. If you prefer other sides and/or snacks, please feel free to bring them. Bewze is also most welcome, as is custom. I can’t wait to see you all, for what may be one of the last times (until my mysterious disappearance, which you’ll explain away and put out of your mind).<br><br>Yours forever,<br>Until we become the masters of the universe we have always been destined to be,<br>Lissendaff<br><br>P.S.

I shudder to think upon it at all, but it must be so, as the flame of our platonic love has dwindled to a tiny glowing ember, struggling to remain lit among the cooling embers around it. But continue on it does, as no distance or time will ever snuff it out. Despite the constancy of my warm feelings toward you, it is nice to rekindle and ignite the flame of our affinity for one another every now and again. I can think of no better means than by covering our mutual admiration in delectable foodstuffs and taking the bellows of good conversation to supercharge and transform the smoldering, sighing ember into a raging inferno of conviviality! As the weather continues to remind us that “spring” is a meaningless term we simply use to define approximately one-fourth of the time we smart and hot monkeys revolve around the sun and that assuming the shifting tilt of our planet means we should receive some semblance of the mythical time of rebirth and renewal we’ve been promised in books and talkie pitchas is a fool’s errand, we will look to warm your gullet with a hearty vegetable lasagna with meat sauce on das side, while the pulsating ardor of friendship buoys you with a comfort and overwhelming sense of belonging unknown since the womb. I think that’s a reasonable bar to set and I believe we can exceed it. So if anybody wants to bring stuff, bread is always tasty and good, or more veggies if you’re into that sort of thing.

Before we are all buried alive tomorrow, why don’t you come on ova and fill yourself up with the warmth of food and friendship? Lis and I will be trying to escape to the sunny south for a week on Wednesday, so there won’t be a Monday hang at Cazallándia a week from today. Therefore, we must pack in two weeks’ worth of hangage in tonight, so take the rest of this afternoon to prepare yourself both mentally and physically. It wouldn’t hurt to be metaphysically prepared, either. Philosophically, are any of us truly prepared for anything in this world? When objective truth is a myth and reality is a construct perpetrated by those in power to subdue the masses into obedience, how can we possibly prepare ourselves for what we experience? The answer is that it doesn’t matter, because you’ve already bought into the myth of reality, and are therefore quite happy being led around by a carrot on a stick, slowly winding your way to the slaughter. But is the slaughter simply release from this hell into an everlasting paradise, which many religions want us to believe? It could be that our existence is merely a way for ourselves to work out psychological issues in a fake environment so we can lead happy, full lives in another world eons ahead of ours technologically, but that doesn’t really explain why my higher self would want to live through the shame and torture of having to floss his teeth when in reality teeth are auto-cleaned by a simple, 10-second nanobot rinse each morning. The other possibility is that this is a mental jail, and waking up after the this brief and brutal life means realizing you’ve been living out a life sentence in a higher plane. The ramifications of this are actually good and bad. Maybe it means you’ve completed your sentence and can reintegrate with society. But if that’s the case, have you aged the full lifetime, or did you live that lifetime in a moment? Either way, do I keep the skills I learned, like Picard remembering how to play the flute/recorder in that two-parter? There’s only one way to find out, and I selfishly hope none of you find out any time soon. Or ever. Another option is that we take over the whole damn thing and build a utopia for ourselves, but that’s a lot of work. We could also focus on building the technology to live lifetimes within our own minds, but make those constructs utopic. Of course, we’ll just eventually wake up from that, but it would feel like an eternity of perfection. At least for a moment. Or we could just have a nice night of music, games, food, n’ camaraderie. <br><br>Soooooo, we’s gonna make some chicken n’ fish, and prolly some rice or potatoes.

While I’m not sure if I have committed too many mortal sins, the Catechism of the Catholic Church lists masturbation as an action that can involve increased gravity. If that’s the case, thank heavens I’ve never masturbated, so that won’t be an issue. Of course, by that I mean I haven’t masturbated today, but the day is still young, so fingers crossed! May the devil not tempt me to commit that heinous sin now that I have full knowledge of the sinful action and gravity of the offense. Even now, I feel the hot, lustful pull of the devil on my psyche, dragging my thoughts to unholy places, keeping me from focusing on my important work of reading insurance clauses in contracts, which doesn’t make sense, as those clauses usually have me thoroughly enraptured. I feel as though I have dipped a mind-toe in the quicksand of the illicit, but this quicksand is semi-sentient and seeks to suck all my thoughts into the muck, and the harder I fight, the stronger the pull into the warm, dark embrace. Because of this, I will request a chaperone for all bathroom breaks I take this evening. Possibly two. I thank all you brave souls in advance for assisting me in my holy undertaking of desperately trying to keep any and all shameful thoughts from taking control of my filthy, sinful hands.<br><br>That said, I hope your own shriving rituals have gone well, ensuring an atoneful Lenten season, to be followed by a celebration of death, resurrection, life, reproduction, chocolate, and bunnies. Cos that makes a lot of sense when you really think about it. While I know all you beautiful people are practically sinless, I hope to encourage your forgiveness of my sins by preparing a hearty shepherd’s pie, as well as a vegherd’s pie for those of you not honoring the Lord your God by sacrificing animals on the reg. I sincerely hope that you all shrive like a motherfucker to overcome that, though I’m pretty sure food-based sins are venial. Unless it’s cannibalism. And that might be okay if you’re warring and enslaving that food. I’ll check Leviticus and get back to you. Ears regardless, I look forward to seeing you all tonight and stuffing our faces full of delicious casseroley type food. Please feel free to bring sides, snacks, n’ dranks as you see fit. See y’allitude long about sebben-firty (seven and one half o’clock).<br><br>Fun note: Today is also known as Peasen Monday in Cornwall, cos they eat pea soup. I hope we have a Pease present this eve so we can also refer to this as Peasen Monday, because we will not be making pea soup. The staff apologizes for the inconvenience.<br><br>With tempted heart and empty stomach,<br>We remain,<br>Yours in eternal torment,<br>Lissendaff\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

Old man winter, jealous and bitter as always, has used his chilly breath to create tunnels of hoarfrost, which, while too cold for humans to begin with, some brave souls have ventured out into the icy maze. This is exactly what that frigid a-hole wants, as he reserves his cruelest torments for those that flout his frosty prowess. Once one of the aforementioned souls has dared venture into his glacial skein, the trap has already been set, and the fearless realizes they are the foolhardy too late, for just as they begin to think, &quot;ah, this isn&#39;t as bad as people say,&quot; the booby trap is sprung. Icy wind gusts from seemingly every direction and cut through even the warmest garments like an ice cold but very sharp knife through warmed brie (or an ice pick through manmost things that are warm, or even cold, I suppose, cos they&#39;re pretty dang sharp) attack without mercy. Too many of our brothers and sisters have fallen this way, and the fear of it has kept us huddled in our warrens for too long. Thankfully, it appears Oh Em Dub has overextended himself, and we will get a (hopefully not so) brief respite from this Siberian tempest. So let us gather together and celebrate the breaking of an old god&#39;s will, at least temporarily! </div><div><br></div><div>Please come over at the yooj time, and we will have a hearty squash soup and some type of protein(s)!

      "body": "Friendlies,<br> <br>At long last, we have reached the most important of holiday seasons. We wait all year long, somehow surviving a constant battle against Mother Nature. Throughout the year, we combat nor’easters, allergy skirmishes that blow up into conflicts and sometimes even wars, blistering heat, torrential rains, and terrifying winds, all for the chance that we will get to gather together for the greatest stretch of days known to man. Yes, children, we have reached the top of the mountain. The Twelve Days of Awesome are here. Help us in kicking off this delightful time of year by wishing J-Bo and Kyle the happiest haps on the anniversary of their birthings! They are what we in the business call birthybros. Culturally, birthybros are viewed in a wide variety of ways. In ancient Mesopotamia, birthybros were forced to have the same haircut and one day out of the year had to act out a Freaky Friday situation with each other, or, if you prefer a more updated reference, a The Change-Up situation. Interestingly, in Vedic India, birthybros were allowed to be elevated to the caste of the highest birthybro one could identify for their birth month. This led to several assassinations, but it also allowed for some hilarious fish out of water stories. Today, birthybros have lost a lot of the cultural and societal importance our ancestors gave them, but we do maintain some traditions without overtly acknowledging them in everyday life. I think the best example of this is that all birthybros are forced to get the same tattoo. This unspoken, but very real, rule is still followed by about 85% of birthybros. One day these traditions will be lost forever, but until then, let us celebrate the birthybros we have in our lives, and force them to get matching tattoos if they haven’t done so yet.<br> <br>In order to properly celebrate the Twelve Days of Awesome, we will provide a bunch of foodstuffs. I believe the plan is currently to make roasted garlic mashed potatoes, sautéed spinach, and some type of protein, whether that ends up being some combo of chicken, fish, and pork. Please feel free to bring salad stuff, other sides, snaxxx, dranxxx, or anything else you might be inclined to bring on ova. I miss you all terribly, so hopefully we will be in each other’s arms again tonight.<br> <br>With sincerest smewchies,<br>Lissendaff\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

I am not sure who all’s around, as we just got back from various locales ourselves, but we cordially invite y’allitude to come over this eve for yet more food, friendship, hangs, and vision quests. We can also regale each other with tales of our autumnal giving of thanks in order to prove exactly who was the most thankful. This will of course be set up as a reality show with testimonials happening throughout the evening, as we slowly eliminate the least grateful bastards in our midst. Then we can finally crown a winner, and hail the King or Queen of Gramercy, who will rule us with what we hope will be a most benevolent iron fist.

Another way to find happiness is to stuff your face with pounds of squash risotto. As the descendant of a long line of land-clearers and sabotiers, I understand the necessity of being well-provisioned.

Those tools are a stomach full of food and drink, and an ebullient atmosphere that will quash any burgeoning sadness that may try to weigh down your psyche and will quell any raging bloodlust that might be brought about by the constant, berating assault of current events that seeks to pummel us into oblivion. Remember, all we need are wooden shoes and an unburdened heart. And some clear land, I guess. It’s problematic due to the history involved, so let’s just gloss over that part and be friends.<br> <br>So please do us the honor of gracing our home with your presence this eve.

Should any sadness-caused tears be detected, the guilty party will be immediately thrown into a friendship rehabilitation pile of hugs. If this does not succeed in filling the cryfeasor’s heart with joy, then they will be administered a euphoria regimen, consisting of jokes, games, more hugs, and, of course, needles full of drugs. We do not know what drugs, exactly, but it’s worked every time we have had to resort to the euphoria regimen, and we don’t question results. Thankfully, it is unlikely that this will be necessary, as you are all wonderful people and we’re going to have a delightful time. In order to facilitate the joy of shared friendship, we will be making chicken and beef to be used in a taco or burrito, or even “naked,” meaning without a shell or wrap of any kind. Now, nudity is not required while eating the proteins in this fashion, but it is highly recommended. The spice gets the blood flowing, causing one’s skin to glow attractively while also mildly engorging the naughty bits (which is both attractive and alluring). The main reason we’re doing burrito/taco ingredients is so that we can make approximately one bootyload of cole slaw, to use up the 2 metric tonnes of cabbage we have in our fridge. We will also most likely make some rice. Please feel free to bring salsa, guacamole, or other sides/accoutrements that you find tasty. Dranks are always a wonderful addition, as well. Finally, it may get a wee bit chilly this eve, but there is a chance we could warm ourselves by a fire if peeps are so inclined. This will be a game time decision, I would expect.

Am I home?&quot; The tension in his normally stern face melted, if only slightly, and a tiny smile played at the corners of his mouth. He sighed heavily. &quot;At least I can finally relax.&quot; Closing his eyes, he knelt down and rested his hands in the grass. It felt soft between his fingers, welcoming. He breathed deep, drinking in the warmth and feeling more muscles unwind. His posture become less rigid, his mind began to drift into a gentle current, unburdened and carefree.<div><br></div><div>At the edge of his hearing barely audible above the breeze through the grass, he heard a faint crackle. The red hue of his closed eyes in the sunlight remained, but he felt more than saw a mote in what would be his periphery.

His body slumped from exhaustion, he felt pins and needles throughout his body. His hands no longer felt the soft grasses slowly blowing back and forth. The ground felt hard, broken, like large gravel. Agonizingly slowly, he forced his burned-out eyes open. As the remnants of the light began to ebb at the edges of his vision, he saw gray ground. His hands came into view, a caked mess of dirt and blood. He turned his hand over, seeing his palm and knowing what lay beneath. A tear fell, diluting the deep red pool that had coagulation there. Closing his fist on that tear, he reached back and struck the ground as hard as he could, a wordless scream emptying his soul of the impotent rage. </div><div><br></div><div>The world shook, and far away, they knew he was still alive.

It feels an eternity since we have basked in the shared glow of our mutual affection. Lachesis has deigned it necessary that our paths diverge for an unknown amount of time. But I say resolutely, “Nay, Moirai, you are merely a fiction, created by the fancies of a people that believed mercury was a suitable ointment and that a womb was a separate creature living within a woman that was eager to bear children, and if ignored would cause suffocation, seizures, and/or hysteria,” and I will fight tooth and nail that we might enjoy each other’s company once again. To that end, I do my part by inviting you to do all the actual physical movement to make this happen and come over to my house that we might feast and frolic in the moonlight, should Artemis’ splendor fight through the clouds that loom o’erhead.<br><br>As a token of my appreciation for this effort, I will provide you with both food and beverages of varied type! The most likely items that will be presented are chicken, a salad of some sort, and we may make a lil’ bit o’ pico. We may have another protein, as well, but please feel free to bring one if sumpum tickles your fancy and might tickle one or more other people’s fancies! As always, sides, dranxxx, n’ elsewise is also always appreciated.

Due to an abundance of Miller Lite in my fridge, we are going to make beer brats. They seemed purty tasty last time, so I’m gonna make the onion topping thang with em, too. We have beets and cucumbers, so if someone brought some greens, we could easily have a salad. We’ll prolly have some other side, too, but that has not yet been decided.

      "body": "She looked down at the inert slab of metal in front of her, wondering again why she worked here. All day, people came in with their crappy and ancient tabs, slates, phones, etc., hoping that she could somehow revive them and keep them going for a little longer. It was the equivalent of working at a nursing home, without the noble pursuit of helping ease people’s pain. All she did was put the electronics back on life support, so this guy wouldn’t have to upgrade to something that actually works. “Hey, space cadet, do you think you can fix it?” the man who was clearly a gentleman asked.<br><br>“Look, I can try, but you should prolly just get a snap, or if you’re one of those old school techphobe types, there are plenty of cheap, new phones that actually work.”<br><br>“Listen, I appreciate the advice, but I need this phone to work, for lots of reasons, not least of which is that I’m going to pay you for the pleasure of fixing it.”<br><br>“Fine,” she said with not quite the heaviest sigh she could muster. “Come back in a couple hours. If it’s not alive by then, you’re gonna have a really nice antique paperweight. That seems like something you’d need.”<br><br>As he walked away, perfectly shined shoes smacking so hard against the tile floor she thought sparks might start flying, she looked back down at the poor, abused phone. It looked like it had been through a lot, but that was likely just wear and tear for something so old. She picked it up and walked to the store’s back room to see what could be done. It wasn’t the phone’s fault its owner was a stuck up poz, so she bore it no ill will. To be honest, she hadn’t worked on something like this in a long time, and couldn’t wait to start digging around.<br><br>Once at her work space, she put the phone down and gingerly placed her hand on top of it. She could feel the circuitry under her fingers struggling to remain connected and vital. The pathways called out in pain and confusion, and she knew she could help. Concentrating, she felt the room grey out, the pixels of her periphery growing to make everything around her blurred. As if looking through her hand, she could see the tiny phone as if it were embers, slowly burning down to ash. Her mind fell forward into it, traveling along the circuitry, finding the worn out nodes and transistors, like a beautiful city that’s fallen on hard times. She drifted through, cleaning as she went, until she finally came across the problem.<br><br>She approached the looming warehouse of memory, and along the edge, she could see large cracks. The pathways between the memory and the processor appeared worn down to almost nothing. She took a deep breath and moved toward the cracks, a radiant glow increasing all around her. The cracks in front of her began to seal together, the material interweaving into a stronger wall than it had been previously. She then cruised along the board, revitalizing the connections, coaxing them back to their former glory. Suddenly, she felt the energy flowing properly again, and the CPU began throwing out instructions as the phone quickly came to life. Information began swarming into her at a rapid pace.<br><br>There was a boy, only slightly younger than her, and he was in a chair. He was scared, but a man was talking to him through a window. The boy nodded, a tear dropping onto his cheek while a large metal apparatus lowered onto his arm and another moved slowly toward the back of his neck. She screamed as the boy did, but the image shut down then, and her focus shifted to an office. Photos of the boy were up on a wall at various ages. A smiling kid in his soccer uniform, some shots of him at the beach. A large man gazed at the wall for a long time, then turned to the two men watching him from the other side of the desk.<br><br>“What do you think?” one of the men seated across from the large man asked. “He should be ready by now.” She could see it was the man who owned the phone. She watched even more intently.<br><br>“Are you kidding? This time it has to work. There’s not enough rug in the world to sweep this one under,” the other underling said. “If we take a little more time, we can be sure, and there will be less chance for error. We’ve come too far and worked too hard. We can’t be impatient now.”<br><br>The two men looked up at the large man, who did not turn around. “Adrian, you are right,” the large man said, almost inaudibly. “We need more time, but you know we don’t have that luxury. It must happen now, and it must be him. We are lost if we don’t do it now, so it doesn’t matter if it fails. I wish there was another way. You know I do.”<br><br>“But we can del-“<br><br>“No. Prepare the catalyst.”<br><br>She wanted to dig deeper, to know more, but realized the man would soon be returning with the phone. She removed any trace that files had been viewed and quickly moved back into her body. The orange-yellow glow of her hand subsided and quickly returned to normal, and her eyes refocused. “Okay, okay, just act bored and make fun of him a little bit. You can do this.” She struggled to breathe at an even pace. She put the phone in a store bag and walked back out front. After five minutes of waiting, she couldn’t resist the temptation to find out more. She grabbed the bag, raced into the back, and reached into it, putting her hand back on the phone. As she dove down, she grabbed what she could and quickly sent them to her snap. She was just about halfway through the reams of information when the door chime broke her concentration.<div><br></div><div>****<br><br>Yo yooooooooooo friendlies!<div dir=\"auto\"><br>I hope you’ve all had wonderful Mondays and are wondering what could possibly make them more special than having hopefully (safely) seen some of the cosmic ballet.

      "body": "“Listen kid, this is gonna hurt.” The voice echoed in his head as he was the metal clamp cover his entire arm. “Don’t worry, you’ll get past it and you’ll thank me.” Then it felt like every pore of his arm was being filled with liquid fire. He screamed, until he felt abrupt pressure on the back of his neck, and the same feeling felt like it filled his spine. His vision went orange, red, fuzzy grey, then black. He slowly opened his eyes and looked at his warmly glowing alarm clock. He rubbed his eyes, and stretched his arms, feeling the nodes in his hand he knew hid just below the surface. Sometimes he wished he would stop having the dream, but he was thankful it always ended in darkness. It made waking up slightly less stressful. And though he always would sweat through his sheets, he liked to think that helped keep him at fighting weight. They say it’s the fear of the needle that hurts more than the needle itself. Having lived and relived that moment every day of his life, he knew that the needle can be much worse. Of course, his was a special case.<br><br>He felt a light pressure in his thumb. He snapped his middle finger against it. “New phone, who dis?”<br><br>“Cut the shit. You’ve got a job. Easy. Just track and tag, minimal security. Deets en route.”<br><br>He had a quick rinse and a nutrient bar that was supposed to taste like steak and eggs, but tasted like a good version of grilled rubber. All that mattered was it was cheap and fulfilled a need. He ran out the door and headed downtown.<br><br>There was a light mist in the air, and he found his mark exactly where he was supposed to be. This guy seemed too boring to be on anybody’s radar. He apparently grabbed a coffee at the same time every morning, sat with his phone to read for 15 minutes, then headed into his office. Two hours later, he would go to a masseuse to work on his back, and then have lunch. Of course, this guy had two employees with him at all times, an obvious bag man and a body man, but that wasn’t too weird for these business types. Can’t be too careful in the wilderness outside your cozy office.<br><br>Lounging in the café the next morning, looking bored and sipping his coffee, he waited for his target to show up. Right on time, the man came in and got in line. His two associates slowly walked around the café and took up positions on either side of his favorite chair, several feet away. While draining the remaining sips of his coffee, the young tracker began squeezing his right fist. His forearm flexed and a small amount of perspiration glistened on his forehead. He hoped the slight grimace of pain was covered by the coffee cup, but neither bag nor body man seemed to look in his direction. He felt a tiny filament forcing its way out of the pad of his right index finger. He continued willing it forward until he felt it was fully made, lying flat on the tip of his finger. He sipped the last and got up for a refill.<br><br>As he rounded the couches and ottomans (ottomen?), he felt the eyes of Bag and Body on his back. He couldn’t let it bother him, he just needed to handle his business and walk out. He stood behind the target, patiently listened to him order a mocha-tea infused with immuno- and metabo-stims, and walked up to order the same garbage. He sauntered over next to the man and pulled out his own phone, thumbing through the top stories of the day.<br><br>“Mid-mochat, dub-fuse up!” The man stepped forward eagerly, clearly looking forward to his morning jolt.<br><br>“I actually think that’s mine,” the young man said, lightly putting his right hand on the man’s shoulder. He felt the tiny filament slip onto the fabric and begin burrowing down. The filament was programmed to barely touch the man’s skin at first to get a precise readout of his current ailments, travel to the area of the spine where his pain commonly resides, and insert itself to live right next to the man’s spine. Then it would emit a signal that could be picked up by his employer. The most the man would feel was a slight itch where the filament entered, and his scratching would only help cover up any other mild feeling that would occur. This also took at least thirty minutes, so as not to immediately let the man know he’s been compromised.<br><br>“Um, no young man, I was clearly ahead of you in line. I’ll be taking my drink, thank you.”<br><br>“Oh, my bad. I just thought no one else drank the same swill I did. Enjoy waking up all over again.”<br><br>There was a muffled rustling from the area where Bag was. Not good. He breathed in slowly, trying to remain calm until he could walk out and get far enough away to trash the disgusting nonsense this man chose to drink. Some muttering to an earpiece, confirmation from his cell. Bag and Body began slowly repositioning themselves to get a clear shot. He began redesigning himself, as quickly as possible. He worked to instill additional elasticity and responsiveness into his muscles, hoping there was enough time. He also began creating chromatophores to replace his usual normal pigmentation cells. His grimace returned, deeper this time, and difficult to hide.<br><br>“Denax detected. Everyone stay exactly where you are,” said Bag, while both he and Body had glove pulsors out and ready. One shock from either would knock him out immediately. There were plenty of other customers around, and these guys weren’t taking chances until they knew who tried to tamper with their boss. As they circled the seating area to approach their boss and the other customers in the waiting area, he worked up on last ditch defense. Repurposing the way too much of his own insides, and trying to not pass out while doing so, his body made two glands in his palms, and started building up noxious gases within them. He was basically creating two tear gas bombs inside his hands.<br><br>“Just a little closer,” he thought, as he felt various parts of his body melting and reforming.<br><br>“IT’S HIM, SHOOT THE DAMN DENAXER!” yelled the target, who had been watching the young man’s face heroically try not to contort from the battle raging within him.<br><br>“Whaaat? Me? You’ve got to be kidding. I just get a little shaky before I have my morning poison.” Leaping up and over Bag and Body, he reached a hand out toward each of them, and a cloud of gas erupted into both of their faces. He sprinted out the front door, as his face, hands, and arms began to blend into the grey day and buildings around him. Within half a block, his clothes started to shift and change in the same way, until soon it was difficult to see anything at all.<br><br>He rounded a corner, jumped onto a dumpster and over a fence in an alley, which I think is mandatory thanks to movies, and ran into a building he knew was deserted. He let the hacking cough catch up to him, and once it was done, he snapped his fingers.<br><br>“Job’s botched. They knew what was up, they could sense it somehow. How can they do that? Who the hell is this guy?”<br><br> ****<br><br>Hellew, dear fronds!<br><br>Pleased to be joining us this eventime for foods, hangs, Thrones, and more hangs! We’re gonna grill some stuff like chicken and maybe sumpum else, and we’re gonna make a bunch o’ green beans. We also have a lot of salad ingredients, but minimal lettuce.

      "body": "Friendliest fiends,<br><br>There was a story once, lost in the mists of time. It spoke of tempests and monsters, of darkness given shape and substance. It was the kind of story that scared the bejesus out of little children, which made it a favorite of older siblings everywhere. As is so often the case, those mists that made the story seem arcane and fantastical merely covered up the parts that made it true and terrifying. There will come a time when we will have to lift the hypomnesiac haze of poorly kept history, or we shall be doomed to a swift and unforeseen cataclysm. I will tell what I know of the tale, and hopefully as a people we can slowly piece together the truth before there is only ash and darkness, and no pots within which to piss.<br><br>In a city not far from here, where the people where so numerous the smells piled on each other and began to physically push the air downward, a young boy was slowly becoming a man. He went to school like the other children, but he felt like he could do more. He knew he could do more. School seemed like a waste of time. He had seen his father grow to prominence, and he longed to reach the dizzying heights that his father had seemingly conquered. He saw all this from afar, of course. His idol could not be spoken to, standing so high on that pedestal.<br><br>So he went out, into the dark parts of the city, and began trying to exert his own control. He found that people would listen to him when he spoke. He could make people do things that under normal circumstances they probably wouldn’t do. He began to go out more and more, to the hidden places, the seedy places, and pushed at people in his mind. Though hesitant at first, he began to like having control over these other people. They did not want to admit their weakness, so they dare not defy him. The darkness became his cloak, and its constant weight made him feel like a heroic victim. In his own mind, he was a savior, despite the fact that he knew minds, and lives, were being crushed under his weight as he climbed on them. He would use this underbelly, this stench-filled pit as a launch pad, and never again have to look at or think about the disgusting, teeming masses he could so easily control.<br><br>And while the tale has barely started, we must pause to think about the here and now and later this evening. We invite you all over for food times, Throne times, and hang times, like ya do. We’re gonna make some pork chops and some salmon, as well as a Mexican-style zucc/squash sauté. We’re also gonna have salad, and maybe some rice. So brang snacks, dranks, and any other things you’d like to consume. See ya at the usualish time!<br><br>Kasmooch,<br>Lissendaff\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "He got up and went to work, just like every other day. It was raining, of course. It seemed to rain every time he had to go to a site for samples, not that he needed them. But the ruse must be maintained. He walked into his drab office and flopped into his desk chair. He thumbed open the calendar on his phone and saw today’s trip would take him 2 hours each way. He sighed, as that meant he’d be in bumfuck nowhere and have to kill time. This was necessary work, though, wasn’t it? Local signage needed to be absolutely correct, or people would not know the relative pH of their local wetlands. He was perfectly suited to this job. He had a power, it just was unfortunately miniscule in scope. He sighed, shoved his phone in his pocket, and walked back out the door.<br><br>As he drove, he listened to Lords of Acid, followed by Ace of Base. He only listened to artists that were puns in reference to his life. He drove to the wetland to be tested and parked his car. Grabbing his umbrella, he stepped out and felt his shoes sink into the dirt as he plodded over to the murky water. He gingerly dipped his index finger into the water. It felt cool, almost refreshing, if it was dirty and likely full of horrible bacteria. But to him, it felt silky and welcoming. It was like he could taste a near-imperceptible sweetness. This took all of one second. He pulled out his phone, jotted down: “Rich fen, pH 11. Sign change necessary.” All in a day’s work. He didn’t need vials and pH strips. Some fucking power. He went to find some lunch and start the paperwork to have the local signage changed to properly name the local geography.<br><br>He returned home to his loving daughter and asked her how school was. “It was great, Daddy! We started learning the times tables and I’ve already memorized some!”<br><br>“That’s great, honey. I’m so proud of you. Now go read while I make us some dinner.” He watched her run off with her latest book, some story about fairies and dragons, and smiled as a mist started to form over his eyes. “She loves me. Why doesn’t anyone else in this world?” he thought bitterly. “No one’s said more than ‘Great job, Rodge,’ in six years. If only they knew why I was good at my job, but then I’d be a pathetic freak to them.”<br><br>“But everyone loves Susie. She’s the sunshine that can break through any cloud. People would notice if she were sad. Or ill.” The thought shocked Roger. “I could never! She’s all I have!”<br><br>“But no one would know. We could easily make her food hyperalkaline, and she would just have some mild sickness. She wouldn’t even get hurt, not really. But people would notice you again, and it would for just being a good dad to your sick daughter. It’s not even really bad. You’re taking care of her, after all!” He clenched his jaw, straining to try and force the thoughts out of his head. A single tear squeezed out from the effort and fell onto the counter. He turned around to make dinner, doing his best to not see himself in the window. He was almost done pouring his daughter’s drink when a tiny bit splashed on his hand. It felt silky and sweet.<br><br>“Time for dinner, honey!”<br><br> ****<br><br>Oh, hey friends!<br><br>Doesn’t that make you wanna come over and have dinner? I promise the food we make will not be poisoned in any way, not even a little bit. I care for you all SO MUCH. Anyways, I obviously learned today that the difference between a bog and a fen was that a bog is acidic and a fen is alkaline. What other kind of story was I going to write? <div><br></div><div>So if anyone is still willing to be our friend and come over to eat, hang, and watch some Gamey Thronage, please come on ova at the regz timish. We’re gonna make some pork tenderloin, chicken, and have a salad of some sort. Please feel free to bring any other thangs that make you feel good, like sides, snacks, accoutrements, booze, or marionette set to entertain the people.

The winds had grown stronger, pulling down the cold snows from the north. Her pack was large, and she knew feeding them would become an issue sooner rather than later. The humans were kind enough to leave mountains of their brethren as gifts, but this would stop eventually, and prey was already becoming scarce due to her supreme cunning and the unparalleled skills of her little brothers and sisters. It wasn’t only the cold that was bothering her. There was something underneath it. A promise. A threat? She was repulsed, but somehow also drawn to it. Not only that, but her strange dreams had increased in intensity and frequency. Her sister must be getting closer. She could feel it. She could almost smell her again.<br><br>She saw the city of stones and water. She saw her little sister defeat her enemy and silently end it with her long, thin claw.

It is my greatest fear that this will be lost on its meandering trip to your hands, and you will not know what became of us at the front. My mind reels simply writing this letter to you, and while I know it we be difficult to believe what I say, to not know could prove unbelievably disastrous. Therefore, I pray nothing befalls the envoy entrusted with its, and possibly the world’s, deliverance.<br><br>You will be happy to know that our men fought most valiantly. For several days, we had the better of our adversaries, pushing back their line steadily and thwarting their counterattacks. We correctly surmised they would attempt a pincer, but our scouts found their outlying divisions and quickly parried their weak attempt at dissemblance. Their army was trapped in the shadow of a looming cliff with a river at their back. As we prepared for the final day’s assault, expecting their unconditional surrender, a confused murmur began among our forward ranks. An aide-de-camp ran back to report on the hesitancy that we felt rippling back through our men. I did not believe him then, as you will likely not believe me now. They say that war is enough to break a man’s spirit, but this went well beyond war and I do not know how we will defeat the mechanized terror we now face.<br><br>It was being reported back that portions of the mountain awoke, and gigantic metal beings unfurled from the rock itself, stretching like dogs waking from a long slumber. Terrified men described humanoid figures but impossibly tall and encased in armor. As you are aware, men will often exaggerate to make their fears seem more reasonable, so I initially thought this to be some new artillery or other large invention. I curse myself for not trusting the men&#39;s description of what trudged toward our position. Fighting at the front is a hell I wish on no man, but these men would be welcomed into an inferno heretofore unimagined.<br><br>The enemy’s line parted to make way for what I could now see for myself was two separate Goliaths. Aside from being encased in a shiny metal of no make I have seen, they did not appear to be armed. Regardless, their mere appearance was formidable enough to make some on our side almost break ranks. Our captains trotted up and down the lines, all the while reining in their horses, who were as afraid as the men but even more eager to bolt a hasty retreat, shouting orders and keeping the men mostly in their divisions. Would that I had sounded the retreat. The two metal beings stepped forward and held up their arm-like appendages, and we saw their shape change. The hand quickly melted back and reformed to become a huge barrel. Gazing into the heart of that barrel was like gazing into the twinkling eye of Lucifer himself, deep enough to see his vengeful, fiery soul. An instant later, we watch in horror beams of fire tore across the field, causing explosions or simply dissolving my men before my eyes. We sounded the attack, and some men, may God forever bless their bravery, charged forward to tear down these mechanical demons. Our bullets and cannon were useless. The monsters were unfazed and continued to rain destruction around us. All was clearly lost, and a retreat was called.<br><br>I stand among a fraction of the army we once thought invincible. We were cut down as easily as a scythe through wheat. We do not know where these beings came from, and we do not know how to defeat them. I hope you have a secret weapon that can defeat gods. Otherwise, we face total annihilation. I wish I could report a single weakness, but we are as children playing at war, and we will be dealt with easily if we do not answer in kind or surrender.<br>****<br>Based on a true story.<br>****<br>Compatriots, it’s another beautiful day, so we’re gonna grill some stuff. I’m making a couple jerk pork chops, we’ll prolly have some other protein to grill, and we’ll have salady stuff! If someone or ones could bring another protein to grill, that’d be great. Other veggies, snaxxx, n’ dranxxx are also always welcome. Pleased to be letting us know so I can make sure we have enuffa da fudz. I apologize for the lateness of this email, and humbly beg for you forgiveness. Regardless of whether I receive said forgiveness, I can’t wait to see your shining faces.<br><br>May your Optimus always be Prime and your Stars always Screaming,<br>Lissendaff\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

Whether this is realizing you can’t keep your pacifier with you on your first day of school because the fucking plebes you’ll be spending all your time with won’t understand how important it is and will ridicule you until you can’t take it anymore, or winning at NHL94 against your brother for the first time and you finally feel like you’re not a little kid, or watching the Doctor regenerate, these are watershed moments. The streams on which our tiny fates float upon, unknowingly swimming toward the inevitable and unforgiving vastness of the open ocean, are guided by the topography of life events, both within and out of our control. Today we will be recognizing the reality of a drainage divide long in the making, but one which was successfully fought against for years. TTT “Pass the ‘ducci on the left hand side” Lauducci will be hanging out with us for one last job, then we’re getting out of the game.<br><br>Yes, through a confluence of work change, baby care, and the ol’ Appalachians themselves, Tommy will no longer be a semi-regular Monday night hanger-outer. So that whole watershed analogy is totally apropos on at least two levels. While our lives may drain in different directions for a while, we will always fight to slowly erode a new path so we visit every now and again, which isn’t really how watersheds work, so that’s where it all falls apart, but goddammit I tried. So yeah, it’s not forever, but it’s gonna be longer than usual between visits, and that’s a pewpshoot. With this in mind, we’re gonna make the most of this eventime! Our plan is to have an old skool grillin’ time, with sausages and burgers. Please bring other thangs to grill you like, salad stuff, other sides, snax, dranxxx, or anyfin else your heart desires.

Granted, this day may be a bit warmer than we would like, and when those shutters are flung open, the beauty making your breath catch just a bit, you will feel the sensation of a million beads of sweat apparating on your face, rapidly coalescing into larger droplets that run into your eyes, stinging the sensitive constitution of the unprotected orb and causing your lids to drop quicker than you can think the command. Let this be a reminder that beauty is annoyance and pain. Beauty in all things is the brutal current form of something beaten into that form, a constant battle we and every other living thing fights against the amorphous concept of a nature that wishes only to annihilate. We create, dream, and revere in hope that these fleeting middle fingers we extend into the void will somehow defeat in some minor way the inescapable concept of nothingness. We also often subjugate, deride, and destroy with a similar, laughable hope. Even the sun, which to all appearances seems to only emanate energy into the universe, does exert pain, pleasure, and influence upon lesser beings while its own life force burns slowly out in front of us. Is that it crying into the emptiness? Are we merely the shattered thoughts of a dying stellar being slowly being snuffed out and drowning in a sea of unfathomable nothing?<br><br>The answer is yes. So we’re having hot dogs.<br><br>We’ll also have chicken sausages and maybe some veggies to grill. I think we have a couple smart dogs around, too. Peeps are welcome to bring other proteins and veggies. Salads, sides, n’ snacks are also always in fashion.

Soon, you are able to create a malleable spidersilk outfit that can is not only stylish, but can repel bullets and enhance muscle tone to superhuman levels. The spider, with whom you&#39;ve established a psychic link, is named Araneis. She&#39;s sassy and blunt, never missing the opportunity to zing your dumb ass, but she&#39;s saved your life multiple times and you&#39;re really starting to bond. You realize her caustic jokes were initially just a way to keep you at arm&#39;s length, but as you learn to work together, you break down the barriers and see through the common spider-human relationship stereotypes, like humans experiencing sheer terror at being in close proximity to a spider, or that all female spiders are friggin&#39; sex cannibals, or that spiders great dancers. There&#39;s also that whole &quot;spiders could theoretically eat the entirety of the human race in one year&quot; study that set back spider-human relations a couple hundred years. But by working together, you and Araneis become a formidable warrior for good, and you learn to dish out some pretty tasty zingers along the way. </div><div><br></div><div>I have a good feeling that this could enter the pantheon of superheroes, with stories being told and retold for years to come. This is not at all like the Eddie Brock with the symbiote becoming Venom, with a movie due out next year starring Tom Hardy. I doubt they&#39;ll tackle any of these coming of age and spider-speciesism themes. So really, what&#39;s the point?</div><div><br></div><div>Anyways, we&#39;re gonna have Monday hangs tonight, and we will also storyboard the above story so we can get our movie out before theirs, therefore stealing all their thunder and becoming a much bigger hit. Or at least making some money by confusing some of the audience. Like Dante&#39;s Peak and Volcano, Deep Impact and Armageddon, Carnosaur and Jurassic Park, Transmorphers and Transformers, or Carnosaur 2 and The Lost World. IT ALWAYS WORKS. </div><div><br></div><div>So, in order to feed the creativity engine, we&#39;re gonna make some pork tenderloin and possibly some other surprise mystery protein! Please bring some veggie sides and/or salad ingredients. Any other snacks n&#39; dranxxx are also always welcome, as you know. I miss you all so much, so let&#39;s snuggle up, write an entire movie script, and watch some hockey.

      "body": "<div dir=\"ltr\">Once, long ago, when there was sunlight and hope sprung eternal from all the beautiful and wondrous corners of the earth, there lived a carefree and ebullient naiad. For as long as she could remember, she would spend her days dancing in and among the springs and waterways of her home, luxuriating in the sun. She and her sisters would entertain each other, playing games, telling jokes, and giving each other ridiculous names. It truly was a paradise. One day, however, everything began to change. <div><br></div><div>The clouds that were wispy and playful seemed to become more threatening, and the light showers that dappled her fair skin began to burn ever so slightly. Soon, there were alien noises encroaching on all sides, and strange, overly-hairy beings that looked like warped versions of herself began moving into the area. Confused, she went to investigate, and saw these spiteful creatures killing her dryadic cousins and tainting her beloved springs and streams. Horrified, she ran to her ancient father, Oceanus, to ask what could be done. </div><div><br></div><div>&quot;My child, you have finally seen man, those that worship the usurper Zeus. And while, I&#39;d like nothing more than to crush these tiny beings to keep you safe, I made a deal with Zeus so I could stay alive and control at least part of the ocean, since he gave the majority of control to his brother Poseidon, which is insane cos the whole thing is fucking named after me, and I&#39;m only allowed to destroy their ships occasionally. So those that make it to this land you will have to learn to live among. If that is too distasteful, your only other recourse is to hide yourself away, and I will shroud the area where you live so that none can find you unless you wish to be found. In the meantime, I&#39;m-a seriously gonna keep trying to kill those em effers whenever they&#39;re on the ocean.&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>So the young naiad hid herself among the humans, and though they expanded all around, they never found her hiding among them. And though she felt trapped in her small corner of the world, she was still able to enjoy the sun and streams. Little did she know that the humans would slowly corrupt all they touched. </div><div><br></div><div>While the charms put around her kept her safe and hidden from the beasts, it could not keep out the filth that sought to choke her beloved creeks and brooks. If someone were to threaten her in the past, she would simply poison them through the water they need to survive, but this was a whole new problem. How could she poison these heathen beings when they chose to poison themselves? She had never heard of the EPA, and therefore she did not know how to file a complaint with the them. Even if she had miraculously overheard some information, she would probably hear that they would likely be unwilling to pursue a company that was polluting local streams, and even if they were eventually convinced to do so, it would start with fines and only escalate to a protracted legal battle in the most extreme cases. And, with nothing to compare her situation to, even if she had THAT information, she would not be able to weigh whether it was worth it to pursue that course of action. </div><div><br></div><div>So she sat next to her favorite babbling brook, deep in thought, when she heard consistent thumping  nearby. Intrigued, as it didn&#39;t sound destructive, but was oddly rhythmic, she peered through the supernatural mist that enshrouded her and saw a group of young men laughing and throwing small bags at angled tables. While she stared wide-eyed at this confusing ritual, she noticed one of the young men was particularly handsome, and might have the genes to grow an awesome mustache. So when the ritual was over, and the others were cleaning up the various components, the young man looked in her direction and caught the briefest of glimpses. Amazed, he told the other to go on and that he would catch up. </div><div><br></div><div>Confused, a little afraid, but also excited, the young naiad simply backed into the surrounding forest, toward her stream. She did not run, as she normally would when humans came too close. She wanted to know more about this man, and she also wanted to know what the hell his people were up to out there. So he stumbled through the woods, trying to catch up, which seemed impossible at first due to the protections blinding him and making branches smack him in the face over and over again. But he was drawn to the face he saw, and could not think about anything other than finding her. </div><div><br></div><div>He finally tripped into a clearing and when he lifted his head, he saw her in all her glory. She appeared to be glowing, with light on and shimmering around her as though it reflected off water. He was mesmerized, and did not even realize they were deep in conversation until the sunlight was long extinguished. </div><div><br></div><div>He told her of his world, and she of his, and they realized they were in love. The naiad&#39;s love for this young man awakened her long-dormant gift of prophecy, which she thought she had lost when she hid herself away, and she saw that the fruit of this union would go on to save her streams and pools. Dark times lay ahead, darker than she cared to gaze upon, but she would bear a shining beacon, created in those bleakest of times. And this hero, born of demi-god and man, will break the siege we have against our own planet. He will be the knight the world needs.</div><div><br></div><div>****</div><div><br></div><div>tl;dr: Brian and Kristen, sitting near a stream, k-i-s-s-i-n-g.</div><div><br></div><div>So yeah, it&#39;s Monday, y&#39;all should come over. We&#39;re gonna make a squash curry soup, rice pilaf, and prolly some fish and pork or chicken. The latter of those things may be grilled, depending on the weather. Rumor has it there will also be salad and a dessert of some kind! Feel free to bring other sides, snacks, n&#39; dranx. 7:30ish is prolly a cool time to hang out.

Beads of sweat began materializing on his forehead as he gazed up in mute, frustrated thought. His heart began to pump, faster and faster, becoming arrhythmic, which caused a feedback loop of stress and worry. His glance cast back and forth from the clock to the woman that stared at him with an impassive gaze, and back again. He felt a buzz on his wrist, tacitly warning that his heart rate was dangerously high for someone seated. As most connected technology does, it had the desired affect of somewhat hastening the end of a human&#39;s life. He tried not to focus on that, but instead stay in the moment and just try to get through this.

The year was merely there to call our attention to the commencement of a series of events that would reshape our world. We have been working toward what has been sold to us as the only safe way forward in a mad world, and we have spent years convincing ourselves this is true. Everything, so far, has gone according to the plan that was codified for all to see in 1948.</div><div class=\"gmail_msg\"><br></div><div class=\"gmail_msg\">The blueprint put in place by the Book had been known for almost the full breadth of human history, it just took centuries for technology to catch up to the true human genius of subjugation and cruelty. Our timeline has almost caught up to the prophecies of the Book. Propaganda is the air we breathe, and while it is not as brutally focused as it could be, we are making strides to ensure the government can effectively communicate with all its subjects, no matter where they are or what they are doing. However, communication must occur in both directions, which is why all thoughts we have must be put on display in as many media as possible. This eases our government&#39;s burden, allowing it to more effectively defend us from the constant wars that dictate life beyond our borders. To maintain our Eden, we must ensure the monster-infested wasteland that surrounds us and seeks to bring us low is constantly fought back, and any monsters that may wear our clothing must be rooted out and either brought into the fold via our encouraging new persuasion tech, or eradicated from all memory within our sanctuary. To not do this would be to invite death into our homes, and surely end our way of life. </div><div class=\"gmail_msg\"><br></div><div class=\"gmail_msg\">Little did we know that an unassuming young woman would be born into the world in that most prophetic of years, and she would be our only hope against the massive tectonic governmental forces seeking to control all thought and thus, the world. Her kind demeanor and giving nature would lead all to believe that she was destined for a quiet life. A life full of friendship and love, certainly, mostly due to her charitable and endearing demeanor, but those in power would have trembled had they known the destruction that could emanate from such a small, beautiful epicenter. Had they known that she indulged in book-learning to an almost demonic degree, they might have felt the change in air pressure heralding the apocalyptic hurricane that would remake life as we know it. </div><div class=\"gmail_msg\"><br></div><div class=\"gmail_msg\">Fomenting dissent was not her forte, so no undue attention was given to her various and sundry salons, often referred to as &quot;hangtimes.&quot; When she did post on the thoughtscapes scoured by the government for clues about who would need to undergo nation-therapy, it was most often an innocuous response to humdrum life events. Instead, this wondrous savior allowed herself to be a conduit for unbridled conversation; the tavern where unfettered revolution can be discussed and eventually the table upon which battle plans are drawn. How could anyone in the various levels of the upper Party fathom that such a cute, unobtrusive young woman would be the steel the flint of the country needed to ignite the fires of rebellion? Honestly, anyone that has ever gone out to eat with her and got sub-par service would know this, but the oligarchs chose not to do the work necessary. And that will prove their downfall.</div><div class=\"gmail_msg\"><br></div><div class=\"gmail_msg\">Tonight, we celebrate the anniversary of the birth of Ms. Alissa Nowak. The best way to do so, in my humble opinion, is to continue the tradition that helped her community of non-brainwashed friends flourish. (Her community of brainwashed friends, while also flourishing, will not be invited to tonight&#39;s festivities.) As we all know, one cannot think clearly or overthrow a government on an empty stomach, we therefore will be making a kale and white bean dish with mussels and chorizo/linguiça on the side, should people wish to add those things. The dish will have some broth involved, but may not rise to the level of soup. We can have a lively discussion as to whether or not it does this evening. It would be lovely if peeps could bring snacks, salad ish, and bread to round out the celebratory meal. </div><div class=\"gmail_msg\"><br></div><div class=\"gmail_msg\">May all your dystopia wither into the ground and become the mineral-rich soil upon which your utopia is built,</div><div class=\"gmail_msg\">Yours in subversion,</div><div class=\"gmail_msg\">Lissendaff</div></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

He was more akin to a virtuous Anansi than an Achilles, and his antics would brighten the days of children and crones alike. <div><br></div><div>He would joyously run across fields, kicking or intercepting balls, casuing children to squeal with delight. He could rap like the dickens, using clever turns of phrase to beat out complicated and delightful rhythms on your eardrum that one could not help but try to emulate. And while you usually failed to reach the intoxicating heights of verbal fuckery, you were left breathless and tickled from the attempt. Beyond this, our young hero was also a bastion of comfort and friendship. If he were to espy someone in need of consolation or reassurance, he would spoon them with the gentleness of a puppy draped in the finest silken sheets. </div><div><br></div><div>Oh, but heaven help you if you were to ever draw the ire of this legend. While it is known that if one were truly blessed by him, he or she may receive the honor of a leg, hip, or possibly even one&#39;s ribs being dry humped by him, he could also use this great gift to reap unfathomable destruction. Once, he was cast out by a city that did not appreciate all the gifts and joy he brought. They were too focused on basketball and other amusements, and did not understand his impish gifts. So he walked into the forest at the edge of town, feeling a sadness he&#39;d never felt before. Once in the forest, he latched onto a large tree for comfort and began weeping. The weeps caused him to convulse, which quickly led to his all-too-familiar humping motion, and put a smile back on his face. So he humped and he humped, until the friction caused sparks to erupt from his loin and thighs, but because he was no longer crying, there was nothing to stop the sparks from becoming a fire that became a raging inferno. (The amount of friction created is made even more amazing by the fact that this young hero&#39;s body was completely hairless.) The town saw the fire approaching, and while some recognized their mistake and tried to plea for help, it was too late. Our hero turned away and moved on to another city where his radiant joy would be appreciated by one and all.</div><div><br></div><div>But then our young hero grew up, as all young heroes do, and moved on from our village. Time has passed, and the world continues on, but it has not gone unnoticed that our world has gotten just a bit darker without the unbounded joy that emanated from this legend. While some may have forgotten, I&#39;m here to tell you this legend is a man, and he still exists. There is still time for this world, for us, and he is coming to remind us of that fact. In fact, he will be here tonight, and we will feast in his honor! So come, raise a taco and a glass to celebrate the triumphant return of our own personal Odysseus, Tom &quot;Tizzy-WHAT&quot; &quot;TTT&quot; Lauducci!</div><div><br></div><div>As noted just above, we&#39;s gon&#39; make taco/burrito stuffs, specifically beef, chicken, black beans, and rice. We&#39;ll prolly make a slaw, as well. Feel free to bring snackypoos, drankydranks, and whatever tasty or fun thing you think would be appropriate for a joyous occasion.

Indeed, we all recognize that personal production and achievements derived therefrom are the most important activity in human existence. To attain this pinnacle of human existence, we must of course be governed by the only moral economic system that has been imagined, <i>laissez-faire </i>capitalism. This system is the only way that individuals can retain their autonomy and become the mythical heroes we are all meant to be, and not be stymied by demonic and controlling overlords. We, as individuals, if left mostly to our own devices, will use reason and our intellect to create a perfect future, where there is no dictatorship of the rich or of the poor. If everyone achieves their personal goals by using any means necessary, then we will at last reach the utopia we all deserve as humans. There is no need to think longer or harder about this, as we as individual humans are all that matter. Remember, &quot;[t]he smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities.&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>Ayn Rand was a fucking idiot. She died 35 years ago today. I would say, &quot;Good riddance,&quot; but we have yet to be rid of her corrosive, inane influence. So I guess bad riddance? Corporeal riddance, at least.</div><div><br></div><div>We&#39;re gonna make chili, and prolly talk about how nice it is to be humans that actually care about other people and have enough basic economic knowledge, or knowledge of history, to understand that unbridled capitalism has proven itself to be...<i>somewhat </i>detrimental to most parties involved. Oligarchs have it pretty nice, I must say. </div><div><br></div><div>So yeah, chili!

I know that some of us may require more of that forgiveness than others, which would then require additional forgiveness for the former being so burdensome, thus creating a ever-increasing pit of swirling sin and forgiveness, coalescing into a black hole, the sheer weight of which would be enough to devour any star unlucky enough to drift near the emotional event horizon. But before that cataclysmic event occurs (which it will, both metaphorically and literally), we can gather together to simply enjoy each other&#39;s company, whether that be through polite discourse, impolite dialogue, raucous cacophony, or playing cards. Maybe we could play some tunes, too. Regardless, these various endeavors, simple as they may seem, are the backbone of civilized and necessary society. Without salons, symposia, or saloons, our minds decay until we become beasts that ravage each other in the streets, just like that Star Trek episode where Troi becomes a weird amphibian and Worf becomes a crazy venom-spewing animal. If they only had a symposium to attend, or some beers with friends, all of that could have been avoided. Regardless again, we must all do our best to enjoy the final throes of the shrovetide, and ride it into a bright and wonderful tomorrow in which we have flying cars and bionic laser-eyes. </div><div><br></div><div>With this incredibly mundane goal in mind, we will make a bunch of chicken (and maybe some other type of protein), a salad, and some rice or quinoa.

But instead we went out and built snowmen and forts, creating walled metropoleis from which to wage snow war on our similarly stir-crazed neighbors. The godless among us would lay on their backs, making false idols in the snow, wretched abominations made to gaze directly at God seated in his domain and mock his frigid majesty. While these blasphemous idols were then likely used as places of power where innocents were slaughtered in honor of these false deities, it was all done in good fun. The main takeaway should be that we forged ahead as a people, and made lemonade snowcones out of pee-snow. We need not be reborn as a phoenix from the ashes! We can come together to plan the long, slow, Sisyphean task of fighting against radical fatuity. To that end, let us make new beginnings!</div><div><br></div><div>As I&#39;m pretty sure all of you know, Lis and I have a new house!

Yes, as most of you are aware, tonight is the last Monday hang at 31 Burroughs. Help us send off the old and turn to the new by gorging ourselves on a traditional go-to of pasta and meat sauce or no-meat sauce. We need to carb up and lift weights to be sufficiently prepared for the mysterious future. But (wo)man cannot survive on simple carbohydrates alone! We would be immensely grateful if any or all of you would bring broccoli to roast or salady thangz.

I hope your rosy cheeks are dimple-deep in some hot cocoa or cider, as you kick back and watch the dusting slowly melt or sublimate, depending on how direct the sunlight is on the patch of snow you happen to be looking at. As the curling tendrils of wakefulness soothe the groggy and abused neural and sinonasal pathways grinding and scraping themselves into a form that can barely be described as functional, let us all remember that it is a short work week, and for that, we can all be thankful. Though that may provide small comfort, that is unfortunately the only kind of comfort my poor human form can provide. However, I will continue to add small amounts of comfort where I am able, in the hope that the universe will accept these comforts as a gestalt, and together they will create an unfathomable reservoir of strength from which we as a species can draw. Wholly in line with this mentality, let us provide warmth and comfort to each other on this solstice day, a day we recognize as when glorious Helios appears to stand still before us, only to slowly turn his back and ride his chariot into the fucking ground for a few months, leaving us wretches to fight the cold and dark with cheap imitations of his radiance. </div><div><br></div><div>So fight on we will! We will not mourn the loss of one shining beacon; we will create myriad beacons of strength and hope! For instance, we will make a vat of chili! Chili is good stuff. Also, Emily&#39;s gonna make a bunch of pork, which is also delicious and wonderful. If some people would like to make a salad or veggie sides of some sort, we&#39;ll have a well-rounded got damn meal on our hands! </div><div><br></div><div>Let us rage, rage against the willful suicide of Helios and stuff ourselves with seasonally appropriate treats!

We must gather together and build our strength to fight against unknown terrors that live just beyond our vision. A hearty meal will do us all a world of good, and help to sustain us when times and rations become meager. To that end, we will be making a large amount of squash risotto, with crispy diced prosciutto on the side. If people could bring a salad or salad ingredients, that would be just lovely. Any other sides or thangs you wanna brangs would also be greatly appreciated.

A weariness has overcome me, and in that weariness, a woolen blanket of malaise has fallen over my thoughts, preventing me from coming up with an interesting topic upon which to pontificate.

One can look upon the past and lament over the time wasted, like that time this morning I found out that Pope Callixtus III excommunicated Halley&#39;s Comet, only to find out that is just a myth, which is sad, cos more comets should be excommunicated from the Church they love so dearly, or one can regret missed opportunities, such as that one time you didn&#39;t write the next great American novel, as it was only published on a small press in Thiruvananthapuram.

      "body": "<div dir=\"ltr\">As my paltry fire begins to die down, I will try to finish the tale of how I ended up here, trapped in a dank cave next to a vast ocean. If some other soul is unlucky enough to end up here, they need to know the peril they face, if they live long enough to read my sorry memoir. <div><br></div><div>The cabin was truly offensive in every way after three straight weeks of lashing rain and unceasing tumult. It&#39;s not that I get easily seasick, or that I&#39;m even sea-averse in any way. On the contrary, I&#39;ve always jumped at the chance to get on a ship and sail to unknown lands. I&#39;ve built up quite a reputation as a journeyman cartographer, and you can&#39;t let a storm here or there prevent you from glimpsing what could be a most fantastic world, full of undreamt of wonders. In my journeys, I&#39;ve seen landscapes that would take your breath away by sheer majesty and I&#39;ve traversed places so strange, one is forced to question whether hallucinogens polluted the region. Hmm...perhaps polluted is the wrong word, as some of those strange lands are also the most beautiful. But I digress. Back to describing the fetid cabin in which I was forced to spend a minor eternity. </div><div><br></div><div>My noxious cell had reached a point of corruption where you can taste the smell. On top of that, the extra dermis I&#39;d collected of grime was not helping the situation. I thought I would get used to it, but each day the environment found new ways to challenge my senses. The rest of the crew was faring similarly, despite their years asea. We could not see farther than two crests off any side of the ship, and our captain was steadily becoming visibly concerned that we would be dashed to bits as the weeks wore on. As luck wouldn&#39;t have it, his concerns proved correct, and our ark of shit was thrown into the teeth of what initially looked like the unholy maw of some deep sea creature, but was actually the equally terrifying immovable teeth of the earth itself, shrouding itself in a constant cloud of spray.</div><div><br></div><div>As the ship was torn asunder between a rock and a very wet place, I was tossed about like so much piffle and fluff. My arm became lodged in the headboard of my modest bed just before my canterbury sailed across the room, striking me in the head, and I knew no more.</div><div><br></div><div>I awoke atop the headboard, bobbing in seas that had finally run the course of whatever virulent ailment had tortured it into a writhing beast for weeks. After carefully extracting my arm from my wooden savior, I was thankful to see I had sustained only a few minor cuts, and I had  some lingering shoulder pain, which I assumed was the aftermath of pain I was blissfully unconscious for. I then looked up, and just at the edge of my vision, I saw another blessed savior, a small, grayish ray of hope. I kept my eyes on the bird and began kicking steadily, hoping that I wouldn&#39;t have the pleasure of meeting some delightful new creature that happens to find human legs a delicacy.</div><div><br></div><div>After traveling in that direction for a day, I spied land, and was able to drag my exhausted nigh-corpse onto dry land. I luxuriated in the sun, exalting in the warmth until I felt I could move my limbs again. Once I felt like walking was an option, my stomach graciously reminded me that there was other business to attend to. Thankfully, the beach was large and had many small pools full of tiny ocean creatures easily caught. There was also an abundance driftwood that had dried out long ago, so I was able to make a fire for myself. I grabbed some seaweed, as well, and put together a rather excellent dish. I couldn&#39;t help but laugh at my luck, not only surviving, but basically landing in what could only be described as a pretty sweet vacation spot. I curled up next to my firepit and slept, dreaming the horrible nightmares of posttraumatic stress. </div><div><br></div><div>When I next awoke, I decided to inspect my surrounding a bit, and I found that one of my large chests, full of drafting materials had followed me like a faithful mutt. I rejoiced at my luck again, knowing that if I could get my bearings and slowly make my way around the area, I would hopefully find some other people, and having my materials would keep my mind sharp, preventing the madness that would otherwise seem inevitable. </div><div><br></div><div>As I walked along the beach, I was struck by its impressive amount of what smallish, dune-like mounds. They were spaced at fairly regular intervals, which was curious, but it could easily be the local winds and soil underneath caused this. After walking several miles in the bright sunshine of day, I returned to my camp, ate my fill of the tidal pool&#39;s bounty, and took up my pen and paper.</div><div><br></div><div>The following morning, I traveled in the opposite direction, finding much the same landscape, including the peculiar mounds. As the day wore on, I noticed a fog rolling in rather rapidly, which could be the front of another storm. Knowing the weather in this part of the world is nothing to be trifled with, I decided to look for cover until it had passed. I was too far from my camp to grab my materials, but they were locked in my chest, and should weather the storm without any issue. I saw a small promontory not too far away, and ran toward it, hoping for some type of shelter. </div><div><br></div><div>As the sun became blocked out, I noticed that the fog was not simply rolling in from the ocean. It appeared to be flowing out from the beach itself. In fact, the hillocks looked like small volcanoes, oozing forth wispy tendrils of fog in random directions. While this seemed odd, I figured I&#39;d investigate it another time, as I was not far from a small cave nestled in the outcrop of rock. I picked up the pace just a bit as I got closer, when suddenly my right foot snagged on something and I fell face-first into the sand. I assumed it was another piece of driftwood, until I realized it was encircling my leg and gripping tighter with each passing second. As I looked down, I realized the fog emanating from the beach itself had somehow solidified and was trying to drag me back to its hill. Frantic, I cast about for anything that could help. I managed to reach a rock and began smashing into the tendril as hard and as quickly as possible. After several strikes, I managed to sever the tendril. Bizarrely, the segment still wrapped around my leg seemed to dissipate. I stared, dumbfounded for another second before I was able to shake myself out of my shocked reverie. </div><div><br></div><div>Scrambling, stumbling, winding, jumping, anything to continue forward and avoid the rapidly expanding nightmare fog, I reached the cave without further incident. For some reason, the grasping arms would not reach into the cave. I didn&#39;t trust this hypothesis, of course, so I spent the next who knows how many hours hyperventilating, wide eyes gazing into an impenetrable fog. </div><div><br></div><div>Eventually, the sun burned through the remaining gray shroud and I peeked my head out of my hiding place. The beach showed no sign of the horror from the day before. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to step on the beach itself then, so I gather small pieces of wood and some food and sat in the cave, wondering if this is where I would die. </div><div><br></div><div>Two more days I looked out across the beach, and nothing had changed. All was still, picturesque. I knew if I stayed put, I would eventually go hungry, lose my mind, or both. I resolved to get back to my camp, see what remained, and bring back my materials if I could. My heart beat nearly out of my chest as I sprinted across the beach, grabbed what papers and pens I could, and sprinted all the way back. The following day, I ventured out once more to gather as much driftwood as I could. Then another fog rolled in. I pressed my back into the furthest recesses of my small grotto and waited. The fog again passed.</div><div><br></div><div>The next several days, I took to lighting as large a fire as I could muster at the mouth of the cave, hoping the signal would draw some form of help. Two more fogs passed through while I slowly used up all the wood in the area I felt I could reach between fogs. The last fire is dwindling now, and I know that I may not be able to last much longer.</div><div><br></div><div>As the fire flickers its last and dies, another fog is stealing across the waves. I shudder and hunker down to try to sleep. Suddenly, I hear a faint cry of &quot;Hello&quot; on the wind. Then followed by another. I convince myself that its just in my head, an aural oasis, or a fever dream borne out of my brain&#39;s last attempt at survival. </div><div><br></div><div>But no, clearer now, and more urgent. &quot;Helloooo??&quot; I rush to the mouth of my protection and peer out. At once, I&#39;m elated and terrified. Two people are walking across the beach, taking turns calling out as they stroll along. By their pace, it&#39;s clear they simply don&#39;t understand the danger they are in. The fog is almost to the beach, and I can feel the despair sink into the pit of my gut. I wave my arms, my hoarse throat making my first yell sound like the croak of a nearly deceased toad.</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;Here! Over HERE! RUN! That fog will kill you if you don&#39;t!&quot; I bellow with every fiber of my being. </div><div><br></div><div>The two wave back, and relief washes over me immediately. That is until I realize they are laughing at what I said, and have not increased their ambling pace. All I can do is stare as the beach begins to unleash the monster or monsters all around them. </div><div><br></div><div>&quot;Don&#39;t let it touch you! It&#39;s going to kill you! Please! RUN! It&#39;s safe in here!&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>I watch in horror as what could be my only hope, or at least some company, become surrounded by atmospheric tentacles. Just when I thought I would see what these mindless creatures would do if given the chance, the couple&#39;s hands began to glow, radiating a warm amber light. They continued to walk at a comfortable pace forward, and the tendrils simply parted before them. I sat down in a  heap, not believing what I saw. They strolled up and stood before me, smiling like sea nymphs, or playful gods amused by my astonished expression. </div><div><br></div><div>&quot;You are going to be fine. Come with us, we live nearby, and there is plenty of food to go around. You have nothing to be fear about the beach anymore. We can introduce you to our protector later.&quot; The young woman held out her hand, and I cautiously took it. As I slowly stood up, the young man said, &quot;Good lawd, you ain&#39;t a pretty sight. Let&#39;s get ya washed up and stuff ya full of sawsijjinpips!&quot; I stared at him for a second and then began laughing uncontrollably, until that turned into full-body sobs, which quickly caused me to run out of breath and heave silently. </div><div><br></div><div>I turned to look up at their now concerned faces and said, &quot;Sure. Sounds good.&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>****</div><div><br></div><div>Sooooooo, as you can tell from that story, tonight is a Brian and Kristen takeover Monday night hang! Not only are they shining beacons of wonderfulness, much like the couple that saves the narrator&#39;s ass in the above excerpt, but Kristen is providing for us during her birthday week! It&#39;s simply too much for our collective friendship heart, it must be near to bursting. They will be making sausage, peppers, and onions, grilled stuffed portobello mushrooms, and grilled pineapple. Please feel free to add to their bounty by bringing sides, snacks, or dranks. Come on ova at 7:30ish, as per yooj! I hope to see you all there, and don&#39;t be bashful about letting them know if you&#39;ll be coming, so they make an appropriate amount of foodingstuffs. </div><div><br></div><div>Smewches by proxy,</div><div>Lissendaff</div></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

While I am not one for prophecy, the oncoming storm has all but appeared on the horizon. I know we are in the midst of some dreary days, and the dreariest are yet to come, but that is why we must fight. We must fight so that in the end, all can revel in the goodness and the Light. </div><div><br></div><div>I know many of you feel that you cannot or will not fight. The threat may seem remote, so why risk our skins against a peril that may amount to nothing? Or, as may be the case with several of you, violence may be generally abhorrent. To a certain extent, I agree. But these are days when we must dig deep within ourselves and view the possible outcomes in the starkest light. Our future, and our children&#39;s future, could be suffocated under a dark cloud of pure evil.  Envision a world where people cannot move or make a sound without being subjected to cruelest torment. That is what I see when I close my eyes. Darkness. Screams. Anguish and ruination. I cannot and will not stand by. I will strike out at that which tries to end us. I will rage against any that try to eradicate our way of life. There is a brighter day tomorrow, but not unless we take it for ourselves.</div><div><br></div><div>Everyone willing and able to join our righteous cause will be given a task that best utilizes their skills. Some will be our warriors. A regiment of fury, a holy wind that will scour the impending evil from our world. Others will be our backbone, and will succor our efforts by maintaining all that we hold dear, and providing the necessary supplies to fuel our just cause. No matter what you do, know that you a vital part of noble enterprise, and together we will secure a safe and beautiful future.</div><div><br></div><div>For those that still may be hesitant, know that we have been lulled into a false sense of security. But soon the battle for our planet will begin, and we must be ready. Tonight is the impetus of our glorious campaign. We do not have much time to prepare, as our ancient enemy has already begun to stir. Murmurs of their movements are in the wind, and I will not be caught with my pants down. We will assign roles to all that raise their fist in defiance to the darkening firmament, and together we will begin turning the mighty gears of war. </div><div><br></div><div>Our task begins by familiarizing ourselves with battle techniques via video. We will then discuss various basic tactics and drill for several hours. I am hopeful, but it will be a hard road. Cicadas do not kill themselves, after all.</div><div><br></div><div>In order to make sure our bodies are in peak condition for the upcoming war and put a fire in your belly, we will provide a hearty chili. Feel free to bring chips, sides, or beverages as you see fit. If anyone wants to grab scallions, that would be greatly appreciated. Report to our barracks at 1930 hours. </div><div><br></div><div>Again, I do not relish what lies before us. But I know in my heart if we allow these arthropodal terrorists to run roughshod over us again, this may be the time that they choose to stay in our realm, and will inevitably spell our doom. Man and &#39;cade cannot live side by side. I expect you all feel the same. See you tonight. If not, know that you may have cursed us all.</div><div><br></div><div>Smewches,</div><div>Lissendaff</div><div><br></div><div>post scriptum: In order to properly prepare mentally and spiritually, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqeKV2UYq1Q\">some inspiration</a>.</div></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "<div dir=\"ltr\">Day 288, deep within the Pwompling Jungle:<div><br></div><div>At long last, we have found the main object of our prolonged journey through the treacherous wilds of the Greater Philuvian Isles. Frankly, we stumbled upon it while desperately seeking to replenish our meager water supplies. We had given up hope of finding it, looking only to somehow survive our dangerously protracted stay. But just when we had given up hope, there it was: the bizarre and elusive Walluöá of Phlewptzecoatl. </div><div><br></div><div>It truly is a majestic creature. Standing four feet tall, it would be rather intimidating, but its visage is softened by large, inquisitive eyes and a grandiose, dare I say flamboyant, crest. A shock of red, orange, purple, and yellow feathers crown this magnificent beast, a radiant diadem bursting forth from it&#39;s rather demure, dun-colored face. An elongated utilitarian beak offsets the gaudy headdress. While perfectly suited for fishing, it is also sturdy enough to crack open nuts, and could easily be used as a weapon, should the need arise. </div><div><br></div><div>The walluöá sits atop two long legs, terminating in very strong talons. Exhibiting a splayed tarsus, the walluöá displays remarkable balance and strength in its legs and feet. While initially we assumed the walluöá&#39;s legs were necessary for wading and fishing, it became clear that those gams were put to additional use.</div><div><br></div><div>And while these birds are impressive to behold for those reasons, their defining feature, and also most curious, is the monowing. In the center of the walluöá&#39;s back is a large, singular wing, extending from just below the banded neck to just beyond the tail. It is hypothesized that the wings of the walluöá&#39;s ancestors fused together over time, in order to become a hyper-specialized organ with which to perform their intricate mating rituals. And while it was shocking enough to come across the walluöá in its natural habitat, we did not know we would be given the unbelievable opportunity to witness the full extent of the walluöá mating ritual.</div><div><br></div><div>It begins with a female standing on the beach of a lake or pond. Males begin to line up, puffing up their crest and extending their wing, undulating it steadily. The number of males in line along the water increases as the tumult of voices draws additional attention. The males continue to do a rapid leg-shifting dance, while continuing the hypnotic wing wave. While this occurs, the female walks down the line, inspecting each male&#39;s dance at distance of only a few feet. The pace of the dance quickens slightly as the inspection proceeds. Finally, once the female has completed her turn, she retreats to a spot in the center of the beach, about twenty to thirty feet from the courting gentlemen, and settles into the sand. </div><div><br></div><div>Once the female is seated, the male at the head of the line, who was also the first on the scene, is reaching a fever pitch in the speed and amplitude of his dance. Suddenly, the male walluöá compacts its body and legs, extends its enormous wing up into the air, looking for a brief second like a sloop at full mast. In the blink of an eye, the walluöá has leapt about forty feet into the air. The bird performs intricate twisting and spinning maneuvers, its parabolic arc leading to the deeper waters of the lake. As soon as the first splash is heard, the next walluöá in line performs an identical dance and leap, the somersaults and spins slightly different but no less impressive. This continues until all the males have performed for the rapt female in the audience, walked back out onto the beach, shaking off the water, and returning to a slower, but still intense, version of the undulating dance. </div><div><br></div><div>While the visual of the mating ritual is breathtaking, another interesting facet is the vocalization that occurs throughout. Once the dance begins, all the males are performing slight variations on a low, chuffling rumble. This builds in intensity as the physical movements do, finally reaching its climax as the bird launches into the air, and not ending the call until the splash of the water cuts it off. It is this distinctive call that the locals heard which gave the rare, bashful walluöá its name. </div><div><br></div><div>Mere words are not enough to describe the feeling of awe one has while watching one of the last colonies of the beautiful walluöá perform their most sacred rite. It is my most fervent wish that we do all we can to protect these lovely and interesting birds, so that we can all revel in the absurdity of nature for generations to come. </div><div><br></div><div>****</div><div><br>If you would like to discuss my journey to Phlewptzecoatl to discover the walluöá and eventually successfully marry into their society, please feel free to come over our house this eventime, at approximately 7:30 PM. We will provide a dinner of pasta and meatballs. Please feel free to bring over any sides, such as salad, veggies, or bread, snacks, or drinks. I look forward to seeing other adventurers tonight!</div><div><br></div><div>Smewcheez,</div><div>Lissendaff</div></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "<div dir=\"ltr\">We knew it would be bad eventually. Well, we thought we knew. When it started, everyone cracked jokes and made wise about how it figures that we&#39;d seemingly dodge a bullet only to get punched in the face. It turns out we dodged a bullet to get stabbed in the gut. You know when happens when you get stabbed in the gut? You stay alive, feeling yourself slowly getting colder as excruciating pain radiates throughout your body, but not quite enough to send you into the blissful embrace of shock. Yeah, we thought we&#39;d be all right, but it just didn&#39;t stop, and there was no help or reprieve. And now we don&#39;t know if there ever will be.<div><br></div><div>I know I was as guilty as anyone. I relished the mild weather and lack of any major storms. After a winter of spring, an optimistic and naive populus prepared mentally for what could only be a spring that felt like summer. Then spring officially sprung. Too bad we didn&#39;t know what was being sprung on us. The winds blew. The snows came. And now we don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll ever stop.</div><div><br></div><div>It started innocently, with a light storm in late March. It didn&#39;t even really cause any issues. But then it kept coming. The storms came in waves, resurgent and increasingly violent. As the inches became feet and the winds took down trees and poles, it became clear that we mere humans could not keep up. Still it did not stop. Supermarkets were not only running out of french toast ingredients and batteries, as they always do when there&#39;s an impending storm, but as panicked mobs continually swarmed through the aisles, all that remained were ripped open packages and produce too damaged to be eaten. Travel was slow at first, but quickly became too treacherous for anything except the heaviest and/or dutiest of trucks. </div><div><br></div><div>The government projected a face of hope, that we would fight through this and reach a bright, shining tomorrow on the other side. But the fight has been long and increasingly depressing. It may be that this is one we just can&#39;t win. A positive mental attitude can only carry you so far in the face of a crushing and mindless opponent.</div><div><br></div><div>Eleven months have passed since that initial spring snowfall, and the few people that leave their homes have formed themselves into roving gangs, breaking into homes and businesses, looking to stock up for the foreseeable future. The police are unable to respond to these threats in time, which only emboldens more people to join their local enclave. The threads of society are fraying apart, and it won&#39;t take much for the whole damn thing to fall apart. </div><div><br></div><div>I remain hopeful, despite being given no reason to. My stir craziness has become an old friend, forcing me to venture alone into the newly created wilderness. I will gird myself with the weapons of a new age: a shovel outfitted with a semi-automatic rifle strapped to my back; goggles with HUD and motion-tracking infrared sensors; snow shoes; and, of course, flask with detachable vaporizer to fight away the blues. Today I head out to seek particular ingredients, and I know it will not be easy. </div><div><br></div><div>Tonight we will fight back cold with spicy deliciousness! An old favorite to warm our hearts and stomachs. We will make beef and chicken tacos/burritos and slaw! If any of you manage to still have or can find sour cream, guacamole, or avocados, please bring them over to add to the feast. Any other snacks or dranks are always welcome. Please come over at approximately 7:30. I will do my best to fight my way back by then. If you run into any trouble, send up a digital flare, and we&#39;ll converge on your location. Tonight is the beginning of a new life, and we will build it together!</div><div><br></div><div>Frozen smewches, frewches,</div><div>Lissendaff</div></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "<div dir=\"ltr\"><div>My dearest friends,</div><div><br></div>There are two things in this world that will light up a child&#39;s smile and brighten her day, no matter what ills may have befallen that her beforehand. Those things are, of course, word play and ancient bases for advanced mathematical and scientific study. Only one time per year are we fortunate enough that these two of our deepest loves are thrust into the foreground where they belong. And that child, who may have just recently lost her pet hamster and is grappling with the concept of her own mortality for the first time, can use this blessed holiday to contemplate on the nature of reality and how we as sentient creatures interpret and make sense of a chaotic and frankly terrifying world. How indeed can a number be not only both irrational and transcendental, but also a homonym for a delicious baked dish? Why would our forebears choose to cram this morass of myriad meanings into such a small linguistic constuct? Is this a clever way to point out that while the actions we take throughout our lives appear to have large impacts and consequences on the trappings of our perceived existence, we are in actuality miniscule parasites on a tiny rock hurtling through a solar system spinning within a galaxy that whirls in the inky void of the universe, upon which we can have no effect. And while this realization may seem disheartening, she will be freed from the weight and pressures of mundane life, and perhaps use this freedom to pierce the veil of our ego-centric reality and lead us to a true understanding of our place in the universe. She can also take heart that both she and her hamster lived in a world with comforts provided by technology based on a constant that, while infinite, has been represented decimally to 13.3 trillion digits, as compared to the ancient Indian and Chinese mathematicians, who could only figure it out up to five and seven digits, respectively. This is why probably why the most noteworthy invention of 5th century China was the horse collar. It was a dark time. I will admit that both cultures prolly made some delicious pie, which would remain delicious as long as you didn&#39;t ask about the ingredients. <div><br></div><div>With these important thoughts rattling around your noggin, please come on over to celebrate Pi Day! There will be many delicious pies, including <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ap995-Hx8CIlii-tDzLH3qpnTQkAUo-x5vNR9WclQQ0/edit?usp=sharing\">all the pies listed here</a>, as well as a shepherd&#39;s pie, and a curry roasted veggie pie. If you don&#39;t want to make a pie, feel free to bring snaxxx, dranxxx, or other goodies, such as ingredients to make whipped topping for pies. I suggest you follow your nose and/or heart. I can&#39;t wait to see you. Please come on over at 7:30ish to revel in delectable baked goods, both savory and sweet! If you need kitchen accomodations for pie preparations, please let us know.</div><div><br></div><div>Consider yourself besmewched,</div><div>Lissendaff</div></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

As the tenuous grasp of winter on our tiny corner of the world continues to weaken, let us shrug off our worries along with our bulky winter attire! Bust out your finest linen or silk onesie and live a little! As we turn to the fiery orb above, the warm caress melting away the cares of brief and forgettable winter. To honor Mother Gaia as she dances eternal &#39;round the loving glow of Helios, we will feast upon the bounty their perpetual flirtation propagates! </div><div><br></div><div>The fauna can breathe easy on this day of mysteries. While basking in the faux vernal splendor, we will provide our furry friends the briefest of respites. Instead, on this most backward of days, it is the flora which will tremble and endure a great reaping. No plant is safe in the face of the insatiable appetite of man. For it is prophesied that there will come a great woman, and she, in her fearsome grace and munificence, will lay low the fields that seek to overrun this greatest of nations, using her unbounded creativity to transform the ever-encroaching menace into a delectable feast for all that harken to her call. </div><div><br></div><div>Lo! The day of reckoning is at hand! Come to the Lissendaff abode this evening at approximately 7:30 PM to bear witness to our greatest triumph over our most devious of nemeses!

As I sit, warm and comfortable in my apartment, scribbling tirades and dispersing them into the wind, I can feel an oppressive weight bearing down upon me; a dread encircling my heart, caustically searching for weaknesses, until it can force apart even the most staunch defenses and snuff out any light of hope within. While recently blessed with a respite from last week&#39;s bitter cold, the unseasonable warmth does little to fight back the encroaching dismay that builds as we all watch a nightmare coalesce in our reality. <div><br></div><div>For a while it was all fun and games. How we laughed and pointed at the antics of the petulant child, yammering out hateful vitriol that was not fully formed into coherent thoughts, but pointed in general directions and unleashed as from a fire hose. Could any reasoning adult be swayed by unwavering, illogical rhetoric? The answer is of course yes, because it has worked over and over again throughout history. But we all agreed this time the joke would remain a joke, and sanity would prevail. Well, as I&#39;ve heard a time or two, that joke isn&#39;t funny anymore. I&#39;ve seen this happen in other people&#39;s lives, and now, it&#39;s happening in mine. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0tE6T-ecmg\">Winter is indeed coming</a>, and we know there will be no quarter given. Let us not wait to let the inevitable smother all hope beneath a spiteful and vicious blanket. Stoke the fires of tolerance and education! A bonfire built on the principles of unity, understanding, patience, and equality can withstand any attempt to usurp our ideals and warp us into soulless wights.</div><div><br></div><div>We will do our best to warm your hearts this evening with roast chicken, pork tenderloin, roasted veggies, and minestrone!

It&#39;s unclear if he cannot or will not move. Looking closer, I can almost see a tiny flickering deep within. A palpable sense of frustration and helplessness, touched with just a tinge of panic barely escapes the seemingly bottomless pit, grasping blindly outward in hopes of finding salvation. </div><div><br></div><div>If I could reach him, could I help him?

What it lacks in creativity it certainly makes up for in accuracy. <div><br></div><div>A teenage girl stands at the top of a trail with her father, eyeing the fresh trail before her first run of the day. To her right, she spots the perfect route to start her day. The path leads up to a lip about ten feet above the main chute, angled just enough that she could try out some gnar-ass shite. </div><div><br></div><div>&quot;See ya at the bottom, pah&#39;dooks!&quot; she yelled as she shoved off, rapidly becoming a multicolored spot behind a veil of powder. </div><div><br></div><div>&quot;Wha-? Just be careful!&quot; her father yelled, sighing at how he can barely keep up with her these days. Was he indeed getting too old for this shit? He pushed off, following next to the path being broken by his daughter. He watched as she turned up the side toward the large jump and a lump caught in his throat. He knew she could handle a jump, she&#39;d be skiing as long as she could walk, but he just couldn&#39;t stop himself from worrying. </div><div><br></div><div>As she launched into the air, kicking off her right edge, she performed a perfect 720 corkscrew, landing breathless and ecstatic. Coming to a stop off to the side, she called out to her dad, who was already shouting back.</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;I did it! I finally did it!&quot; she yelled, jumping up and down awkwardly. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I hit that!&quot; </div><div><br></div><div>&quot;I know! It was amazing! You did great, honey. Now let&#39;s-&quot; he cut off abruptly. &quot;Do you hear that?&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;No, I don&#39;t hear anyth- oh, no.&quot; </div><div><br></div><div>A rumble was building that they couldn&#39;t quite place. As the blood drained from their faces, they turned to look up the hill. Far above them, they saw what looked like a cloud rapidly coming toward them. The two looked at each other and wordlessly turned to get down the hill as quickly as possible. </div><div><br></div><div>Despite racing down at a breakneck pace, they could feel the weight of the avalanche bearing down on them. Caution thrown to the wind, both father and daughter willed themselves to go faster. For a few seconds, they seemed to be making some progress distancing themselves from the wall of terror crashing toward them. </div><div><br></div><div>As that happened, the girl noticed her father was getting just a bit ahead of her. Even though she knew both of them were skiing for their lives, the last thing she wanted was to lose a race. She made herself as compact as possible and leaned forward as far as she could, trying to overtake her father and, you know, not get smashed and/or buried alive. </div><div><br></div><div>As she started to close the gap, something caught her right ski, and she flipped and landed hard, her skis exploding off her feet. Not that she could notice, as she was rolling down the hill at 60 mph, barely conscious. After several endless seconds, she came to a halt in the middle of the trail and lay still. </div><div><br></div><div>Her father glanced behind him, surprised he hadn&#39;t seen his daughter shoot past him and flash him a mischievous grin. His glance caught the skis up the hill, laying far from where he saw his little girl tumbling forward and come to a stop. His heart froze, and he almost fell headlong down the mountain, as well. He managed to stop, and desperately tried climbing up the hill, his senses were overwhelmed by the deafening roar now looming in front of him. </div><div><br></div><div>Before he could reach his daughter, an enormous brown bulk came from seemingly nowhere, screeching to a halt between his little girl and their impending doom. He couldn&#39;t believe his eyes as he saw a huge moose stamping his hooves into the snow and face the full wrath the mountain. As he watched, he heard a guttural growl quickly turn into a roar louder than the maelstrom. Suddenly, the avalanche began to part around all three of them, smashing and crushing all in its path, but leaving them completely untouched. </div><div><br></div><div>After what seemed like an eternity, the deluge of snow came to an end, and the man was able to make his way up to where his daughter lay. As he reached her, she slowly came to. </div><div><br></div><div>&quot;What happened?&quot; she asked groggily. &quot;I have no idea. But I&#39;m pretty sure this moose saved our lives.&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>Turning around, the moose couldn&#39;t help but laugh as the two gaped openly at their savior. &quot;Bon jour, mes amis! Quite a scare we all had there, no?&quot; Lighting a cigarette and smoking it underhand, or underhoof, I suppose, the moose stepped toward them and straightened his beret. &quot;Come now, do not be afraid! We will fetch your skis and I will give you a ride down.&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;Who, wha-, what the hell are you?&quot; asked the father. &quot;Moi? I am simple moose, who happens to enjoy the finer things in life. And to me, one of the finest things is making sure people stay alive. As for who I am, those closest to me know me as Moostachio. Now, shall be on our way?&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>And with that, he scooped up the two people and put them on his back, as he bounded across the broken and battered hillside. </div><div><br></div><div>****</div><div><br></div><div>So come on over for the yooj Monday night hangs!

      "body": "<div dir=\"ltr\">In the corner, a young man dressed far too well for these grim surroundings, is slumped in a chair, his white-knuckled grip permanently etched into the bottle in his lap. A TV in the corner flickers slowly until suddenly coalescing into the face of a beautiful young woman, reminding us that we could be just as elegant as she, if only we could buy more perfume. The sudden noise rouses the young man, causing a sharp intake of breath, but as the heavy burden of reality settles on him, his movements immediately become slow and deliberate. He squints painfully, his brow creasing in an effort to contain the cacophony threatening to burst forth from his skull. <div><br></div><div>His eyes still closed, he takes a long pull from his personal cruet, its contents crossing the event horizon until the dry glass is hurled at the wall behind the TV in anger. A cloud of dust erupts, sparkling like ashen snow in the pulsating glow of the screen. He stands, stretching his arms and cracking his neck, his temples visibly throbbing, and measuredly walks toward the window. Tossing the heavy curtain aside, a violent glare of bright white forces him to stagger backward. The glare haltingly ebbs and reveals a bustling street. People milling around coffee shops, walking hurriedly between obviously important appointments and meetings. A young woman running out of her door, lipstick in her hand and coat still unbuttoned, waving her arms in vain at the bus thundering past. A group of teens, laughing and texting each other as they stamp past a man sleeping in the shadow of the buildings he can&#39;t afford to enter.</div><div><br></div><div>As he casts his eyes downward, slowly remembering why he wanted that bottle to never leave his hand, he notices a small crease at the edge of the window. The corner seems to have lifted just the tiniest amount. Scratching curiously at the edge, it curls upward just a bit more. Curiousity becomes determination as he realizes the whole window has a bizarre film glued to it. In a few minutes, enough has been peeled to get his whole finger under, then up to his palm. He grips the revealed edge, which is somewhat duller than the shiny scene still playing out before him, and pulls, but it barely budges. He grabs at it with as many fingers as he can, struggling to reveal just a bit more. Frantically, he kicks his foot up against the wall, and yanks with every dulled fiber of his being. With a deafening roar akin to a thousand strips of velcro encircling each ear drum, the window, hysterically denuded of its lively veneer, reveals a shockingly drab view. </div><div><br></div><div>Before him, as far as his bleary eyes could see, lay shambles of buildings, some half-buried in ruddy dunes, others windswept into a grotesque version of Monument Valley. Staring, he felt his knees begin to shake. The cacophony, which he had ignored in his frenetic attempt to uncover the window, redoubled its efforts. Falling to his knees and writhing onto his side, he catches a glimpse of light reflected from a shard of his discarded confidant, as it dances along the outline of a row of bottles hidden on a bookshelf behind the seedy loveseat. Army crawling forward, he looks back at the shimmering glass, to thank it for unveiling an easy way to forget, only know noticing the shard was not alone. It stands on a pile of its brethren, almost as tall as the television. A glittering pile of faux jewels, partially hidden by messages of luxury and class. Was that shimmer an encouragement toward action, or was it simply trying to tell him how to forget?</div><div><br></div><div>Before he could determine the alignment of the fractured oracle, the tumult in his head erupted from his lips, as discordant thoughts snapped into vivid clarity. Knowledge pounded into him in unceasing waves. Finally, as his bloodcurdling scream turned into a maniacal cackle, his writhing became an acute rattle, and he knew no more. </div><div><br></div><div>Snapping my eyes open, I gasp at the brightness in the room, breathing as though for the first time. All I can see is a blur of colors, confusing. I can remember something terrible from my dream but can&#39;t quite put my finger on it. I shut my blurry eyes against the brightness, and feel my surroundings. I feel a smooth wall on either side and notice small tubes protruding from my nose and mouth. Frantically, I sit up and open my eyes again, trying to slow my breathing, as I draw out the tubes through coughs, and allow myself to focus. </div><div><br></div><div>Bit by bit, it comes into view. A beautiful sunset, light radiating through unknown chemicals in an explosion of purples, reds, and oranges. The soft sound of the sea not far away, somewhere just over the bright green hills on each side. I stand up, take an uneasy step forward, and wonder if I&#39;m alone. I resolve that I&#39;ll worry about that later. For now, a light rain begins to fall as I walk forward into this new life. I felt like an actor, walking out into the wild purple yonder, leaving his Ma to seek his fortune. I just hope there&#39;s some sort of fortune to seek.</div><div><br></div><div>Segue to....</div><div>It&#39;s a TAKEOVER MONDAY! Benihhanoush will be creating a delectable and exotic meal inspired by the cuisine of India! I know that there will be tandoori chicken and veggie dishes, but that&#39;s the extent of what I know. Please inquire with Ben for specifics if he needs anything, but snacks, drinks, and elsewise are always appropriate. Hope to see you this evening. </div><div><br></div><div>Oh no, love, you&#39;re not alone,</div><div>Lissendaff</div></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

It is all too easy to succumb to this warm embrace. But this, my brothers and sisters, is a shallow, unfulfilling warmth, which will inevitably lead to an emptiness within your soul that can only be satiated with repeated viewings of childhood favorites, like Muppet Babies or Faces of Death. <div><br></div><div>I say no more! This single week of cold temperatures will not beat us! We will not go quiet into our frigid night! We must arm ourselves by embracing that which kept us invigorated and radiant throughout 2015. We will stand together, defiantly enjoying spicy tacos perfectly balanced with crunchy coleslaw!  We will be a beacon of hope to all those who give in to the horror of Seasonal Affective Disorder, burning away the sadness with the renewed and reaffirmed fire of our friendship. But just as Archimedes burning-glass could not work with just one mirror, you can assist our cause by bringing condiments (soured cremes, salsas, havocados, etc.), snacks, sides, or drinks, all of which will serve to focus and amplify the power of our weaponized friendship. </div><div><br></div><div>Our life begins anew tonight at our abode at approximately 7:30 PM. I hope to see you all there, as a fire&#39;s magnitude is, of course, exponential in nature.</div><div><br></div><div>Smewch,</div><div>Lissendaff</div></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

I wish you all safe journeys and splendid homecomings. I also hope everyone is greeted with a white chocolate mocha peppermint martini, garnished with a heart-shaped sprig of mint stabbed through with a candy cane. If this does not happen, I hope you can put on a brave face and struggle through the season anyway. Remember that your brain is stronger than any physical stimuli, and you can probably convince yourself you are lounging in a sauna, leaning back lazily with an ice cold white chocolate peppermint martini that is rapidly melting onto your hand. You tilt your hand slowly, watching the luxurious velvety tendrils run down your outstretched arm, not feeling weird or sticky, but the sultry coolness somehow radiates inward and mixes with the heat from the sauna in a thunderstorm of pleasure that you can barely contain. And you feel this, despite the fact that you are sitting in a room you&#39;ve sat in hundreds of times and know you should recognize, but dusty boxes of faded memories and piles of wrapping paper in mid-use, interspersed with bags overstuffed with bows make the whole scene feel just a tad surreal, reminding you that your childhood is dead and gone. There is work to be done. Happiness is earned. You will have to face your reality and win the holidays. I do not envy your path, but I envy the true joy you will find celebrating with your loved ones.  You will be in our thoughts, please don&#39;t forget us in your jubilant revels. </div><div><br></div><div>For those few left behind, do not despair! We will build a new Monday night hang, one bereft of the hustle and bustle. A Monday where we can solidify our bonds of friendship with deep discussions of childhood trauma and triumph, and work through any current issues with advanced therapeutic painting and interpretive board gaming. </div><div><br></div><div>Please feel free to come over at approximately 7:30. I believe the menu will contain a beef roast with some root veggies, as well as a kale and spinach salad that will have various other things in it, maybe some squash, maybe some apple. There&#39;s a possibility of soup, but that portion of the horizon remains hidden from me, as well. As we all know, the truth will out! But at a later time, so cool your jets. Please let us know if you are one of the few gallant souls that remain to watch over the wind-swept plains of Jamaica, so we can make sure we procure the proper amount of victuals.</div><div><br></div><div>Pepperminty smewches, </div><div>Lissendaff</div></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

My life is immeasurably better knowing you all, and I wish to celebrate you this eventime, by having you come over my house, have some delicious food prepared by Ms. Pease (if you&#39;re nasty), maybe some bebidas, and perhaps learn some important life lessons, such as how to best impersonate a dwarf as a world class actor. Please feel free to bring sides, snacks, and boozey thangs! I would suggest directing all food-related questions toward the Peasemaestro, as she is in charge. If any are posed to me, I will stare at you blankly for a couple seconds and then fly into an unthinking bestial rage. Don&#39;t worry, no physical violence will occur, I will merely be posturing to scare you off my territory and distract you from my painful and embarrassing lack of helpful information. This will mostly consist of leaf-throwing, stomping, and gnashing of teeth, interspersed with snippets of songs by Cher.</div><div><br></div><div>Feel free to come over at 7ish, and we will dance like everyone&#39;s watching and we get paid to do it and we know we&#39;re the best so goddammit we&#39;ll give &#39;em a show.</div><div><br></div><div>Old, dusty smewtches,</div><div>Lissendaff</div></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

I awoke like 5th movement of the Symphonie Fantastique: intially tripedatiuously questioning and worried about the day to come, but eventually becoming bombastically active and running to greet the day. Initial naive excitement lead inevitably toward the forever repeating, deliberate plod through the workday. Flashes of dalliance and frivolity accent the monotony, but I am always dragged back to the slog and peril of the day. The trudge gradually picks up speed, like a boulder being tumbling toward its terminal velocity, until this rush of action brings me not to my inevitable demise, but a jubilant celebration of existence, a triumph over the perpetual marathon through a morass of shit. You are the trophy. You are the celebration and the salvation. Let us join together in joy and continued thanksgiving!<div><br></div><div>We are going to make pizzas tonight! Out of cauliflower, if you can believe it! Please feel free to bring over your favorite toppings or ingredients. We&#39;ll prolly have pepperoni and broccoli, as well as some cheese and sauce.

      "body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The banging in my ears is so loud, I can&#39;t even think. Where the fuck am I? And why the hell can I actually see the beat of the drums ripple across my eyelids? As my eyes open slowly, I realize it&#39;s my own heart roaring in my ears. Also realizing that I can&#39;t see anything when I open my eyes doesn&#39;t do much to help calm that shit down.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I feel a weight across my back and shoulders. I push against it, feeling it shift ever so slightly. A deep breath, two, three, PUSH! I hear wood groan and crack, followed by a pulpy thud. The pall of darkness pulls back ever so slightly, so I can just make out a door frame in front of me. I look down to my left. The door, seemingly burst off its hinges, lies on the ground, sporting an avant garde uneven-hole-in-the-middle look. Not exactly my style, but I&#39;m sure these people had their reasons. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before I can take in more of my surroundings, my eye catches a a liquidy shimmer. Horrified, I realize it&#39;s a hand. I jump to throw the door aside, and pull up short. The view greeting me grabs my bowels and tugs with all its might, which could have led to a truly embarrassing scene if my workout regimen did not include a steady dose of pelvic floor exercises. Thankfully, I make sure I warm up, work the floor (or &quot;cut a rug,&quot; as the crossfitters say), do my general cardio/weight lift reps, at which point its back to pinning up the downstairs hammock, and then a solid cool-down. Ain&#39;t no way I&#39;m losing control downtown. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite my excretal dominance, I can&#39;t wipe the shock from my face. The hand freed from the debris is just that, only a hand. The grisly appendage causes memories to flood in: the scratch marks, the ever-increasing rustle of feathers, and finally, the tell-tale menacing cutts. And there it is, lying before me, it&#39;s soulless eyes staring deep into the pit of fear in my gut: the Gobbling Dead. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I shake my head, struggling to stay afloat amid the cold waves of terror surging through my mind. As they pass, an island of resolve appears on my periphery. My salvation comes into focus, solidifying in the shape of a pistol grip .30-06. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hunting season&#39;s open, and I&#39;m gonna blow the wattle off every undead Jake, Jenny, and Tom I see. &quot;Time to open up a can of cranberry whoop-sauce!&quot; I defiantly say to my first victim. Thankfully only Steve&#39;s arm is around to hear my feeble first attempt at badassery, and recently-re-deceased zombie turkeys don&#39;t say insults. I&#39;ll make sure I&#39;ve got something better next time. I&#39;ll hopefully get a few in before I triumphantly rescue some poor schmoes with a phrase that&#39;ll let &#39;em know with me, they have a chance to give thanks this month. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With a bullet, <br>\r\nLissendaff </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">P.S. We&#39;re gonna make tacos! We&#39;ll have ground beef, beans, rice, and slaw.

We are the unwitting bystander to an ancient brotherly spat, and we may be lost long before either can claim the victory. <br></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For two days, we struggled along, hoping to bear down and sail steadily through the watery fists batting us about. Despite being enveloped by darkness and relentless upheaval, the men held course, shouting challenges to the very gods themselves to quell their spirits. Sadly, the gods were all too keen to reply. A keg of Her Majesty&#39;s finest kill-grief was firmly lashed under the quarterdeck, but it became loosed from its bonds and shot across the ship. Several men working to maintain the mizzen were taken unawares by the hurtling cask and knocked off starboard. A truly horrifying loss of life multiplied by a loss of our only coping mechanism. <br></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It wounds me terribly that their bravery may go unheralded in the annals of our heroic nautical forebears. They were giants, and it blackens my heart to say that we may end up as grisly decorations on a broken, scuttled reef.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As you can imagine, events have not turned in our favor despite these Herculean efforts. Today, as I stood on the poop, desperately fighting to control the beast beneath me, a bolt shot out and hit the drogue line. In seconds, it sheared off and disappeared into the roiling sea. We have now been forced to drift ahull, unable to even attempt slowing our inevitable descent into oblivion. <br></p><p>Though we may not know where we will end up should we survive this ordeal, I pray that you do not put your lives on hold for worry over us. I still have hope, though it sputters like the candle I use to write this letter.

A tooth that slowly blunts with each passing day, allowing one to bear the long, slow trudge of the week, not noticing the unending, futile nature of that which we all have decided to partake in. </div><div><br></div><div>Bless the dulling of our senses! Bless the repetition which gives our world shape and makes us feel safe!</div><div><br></div><div>In order to celebrate that which maintains and fulfills us, we invite you to join us this evening at our abode yet again. Remember, regularity is freedom. Schedules are contentment. Without this compass, we will all surely lose any concept of civilization. We will begin killing each other for sport and pick our teeth with used hypodermic needles. Feral children will devour puppies. Do not dwell long on thoughts of that path, my beautiful siblings! Come to our home and be safe. Enjoy some veggie soup and pasta salad. Feel free to being beverages, vegetables, or ther snacks or meats. </div><div><br></div><div>I look forward to spending an evening of quiet enjoyment with all of you.</div><div><br></div><div>Let us pray,</div><div>Lissendaff</div></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "<div dir=\"ltr\">Okay. I think that subject will throw them off the scent. <div><br></div><div>To whomever this reaches, please, find help. Don&#39;t try to do this alone, you&#39;ll only get yourself killed. And don&#39;t, for the love of god, don&#39;t rush anywhere. You don&#39;t want to raise suspicions, cos then we&#39;re all screwed. We&#39;ve made contact, and for that, I&#39;m thankful. </div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m not sure what I can tell you to get us out of here. We&#39;ve been stuck in some sort of basement or hidden closet for what feels like days. We can hear muffled sounds of music, furious typing, and some kind of mechanical work; it makes no sense. There&#39;s no light, so I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s been or how many times we&#39;ve fallen asleep, but every so often food appears. I haven&#39;t eaten any yet. I&#39;m worried it could be mildly poisoned to keep us weak and docile. I need my mind sharp if we&#39;re gonna get out of here.</div><div><br></div><div>After searching through the piles refuse cluttering our dark confines, I found what I hoped could be our ticket to freedom. Behind a towering stack of slowly decomposing Ranger Rick mags, I found a busted up Tandy 2000. The screen was slightly cracked, but everything else seemed to be intact. I knew if I could find just a few more parts and an outlet, we could get a message out. </div><div><br></div><div>I worked on lil&#39; Tandy nonstop, trying not to sweat on the delicate circuitry, and trying to keep my exhausted, shaking hands from breaking a transistor or severing a wire. This was our only hope, and I didn&#39;t want to wet the flare, as it were. While I toiled away, I wondered how much longer we&#39;d last in this pit.</div><div><br></div><div>This morning, or I guess what we&#39;re calling the morning, I received a cryptic message written on a ripped scrap of paper. It just said, &quot;We will do a take over. Hope you like grilled salmon, grilled veggies, salad, and brown rice.&quot; Now I don&#39;t know what the fuck that means, and, frankly, I&#39;m terrified. Is this a terrorist plot? A guerrilla group that&#39;s amassed enoughs arms to make its move? It&#39;s definitely a threat, but I simply cannot figure out the slang translation of the courses of a meal. Maybe the stages of their plot? The order in which they perform torture techniques? </div><div><br></div><div>While I racked my brain, searching for an answer, I realized something. It doesn&#39;t matter. As long as we&#39;re stuck in here, it doesn&#39;t fucking matter. The ONLY thing that matters is getting out to warn others and stop who or whatever kidnapped us in the first place.</div><div><br></div><div>I redoubled my efforts on my sweet lil&#39; Tandy, now sporting some lipstick and a <a href=\"http://www.electronicsweekly.com/gadget-master/arduino/jaunty-fascinator-moving-head-show-2015-01/\">jaunty fascinator</a>, knowing that we had precious little time. I was able to cobble together a crude modem and fired ol&#39; Tandybear up. Shockingly, I was able to find an unsecured wifi signal, and now I&#39;m sending you this. </div><div><br></div><div>Shit,someone&#39;s outside the door. I&#39;ll finish this and email it once the coast is clear.</div><div><br></div><div>**************</div><div><br></div><div>Okay, now I think some semblance of a plan is coming together. Just now, when someone came to change out our water jug, I overheard two people speaking in hushed tones. Male and female I heard them. Their plan is to strike tonight. I don&#39;t know who will be able to help put a stop to this diabolical plot, but that&#39;s why I&#39;m emailing everyone. Don&#39;t worry about us just yet, it&#39;s more important to stop these twisted fucks. </div><div><br></div><div>Go to our house, you know the place on Burroughs. I think they said something about 7:30, but I couldn&#39;t hear if they said post or ante meridiem. God, I hope it&#39;s not too late. This has to relate back to the coded message about grilled salmon, but I have no idea what sinister plot that could tie into. Regardless, show up and put a stop to these two, whoever the hell they are. Let me know if you&#39;ve heard anything, I&#39;ll try and fire up Ms. Tandybutte as often as I can to see how many people can help finally put an end to this madness. </div><div><br></div><div>To use coded language similar to theirs, I suggest you bring &quot;beers,&quot; &quot;wine,&quot; &quot;veggies,&quot; &quot;snacks,&quot; or &quot;a gun.&quot; We&#39;ll keep searching for a way out. If we do, you better believe your cute butt we&#39;ll be right there next to you, fighting against this unknown, unspeakable evil. </div><div><br></div><div>Besuqueábamos,</div><div>Lissendaff</div></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n",

Or will she be too busy with her stupid, shmarmy new husband? Will Jon Snow ask that freshly-wighted lady for a dance? They made some serious eyes last episode, and if anyone could melt a wightess&#39; heart, it would be Sarah Mayo&#39;s hall pass, Jon Snow. My personal vote for prom king and queen is Ramsey and Sansa. They finally get that couples&#39; counseling they needed and really start seeing eye to eye. Then they straight up murder everyone at the prom and share a wild-eyed, passionate beso sangriento. My heart&#39;s aflutter just thinkin&#39; it.</div><div><br></div><div>As you all know, the last thing you wanna do is go to the prom on an empty stomach, cos you know some jokester like Lady Olenna, Arya, or any Martell will spike/poison the punch, and an empty stomach&#39;s the fastest ticket to Ralph City (which is in the Shadow, south of Asshai). With that in mind, we&#39;re gonna grill a bunch of meat and possibly some fish, as well as some zucchini. We may also roast some broccoli. If people would like to bring other veggies or meats to grill, that&#39;s way cool. Please let us know if you&#39;re partaking in food, so we&#39;re sure we gotst enuff.</div><div><br></div><div>As a quick note about schedule, we&#39;ll do the usual 7:30 timeframe. The Stanley Cup game is at 8 PM this eventime. I will be DVRing it, so we can watch a bit of that as we cook and eat, and then we&#39;ll pause the game in order to take prom photos together, and then watch the prom spectacular on GoT. Once we&#39;ve danced our little hearts out, and the king and queen have been named, and we&#39;ve finally sealed the deal with whomever we&#39;ve been trying to since months before the prom, I&#39;ll put the game back on, complete with fast-forwarding technology.
